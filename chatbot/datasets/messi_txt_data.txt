only lionel messi has more in every category balls riqui actually had talent at that time he was probably the only player who could play passes that cut through the defence apart from messi and busi think without bias abeg he s gone to shit now because we have players better than him and he didn t consider loan moves when messi winning everything then you will blame all of them even if messi become portuguese now you will blame the president why bringin the goat to the cr s country messi won the treble with barca in ronaldo only has the ucl competition as a top goal scorer that s one competition out of many and before you talk about having the highest goals in football history mins per goal messi still best him in that regard psg without mbappe is much much better the chemistry between messi and neymar is far better mbappe plays individual game a lot since only messi ibra and ronaldo has scored more goals from outside the box than pjanic psg want to renew leo messi s contract fc barcelona want to start conversations in the coming months amp mls is also an option he will decide in january february messi is the goat talkyourtalk messi if you tell me ronaldo is better than messi then you don t know ball simple did messi say anything about ramos and what about mourinho he is sooo arrogant football aside messi is far more humble than him that s one way to announce yourself first thing i thought when i saw this imagine the reaction if this was messi ronaldo or zlatan this goal is world class and can t wait to see what damage he causes this season just to make it easy for you messi xavi iniesta valdez puyol all started playing for barcelona first team before that s the point no wars that s pretty significant confirmed xavi will be very happy to sign leo messi they are in constant contact amp remain good friends laporta is dreaming of his return as well messi be like mending turu as a messi fan ronaldo has a net worth of b btw always on top messi we don t care man difference between messi and ronaldo is this messi is quality and ronaldo is quantity you expect everyone going for best when they could settle for the best aside from goals what else does ronaldo have am waiting ucl and world cup are the only finals which matter the most and ironically messi choked in both messi work smart not hard but your not the messi of ta dude bruh the only position messi can t play will be gk and that s cause of his stature put the mf as a cb and no one gets pass him if ever you are asked who the greatest footballer is just tell them it s the person most looked up to and imitated by his peers and the younger generation messi cr fifa stats comparison of lionel messi and man utd s ronaldo s stats in finals reveals the winner mufc news the

man united fan the original comment was never about psg or coaches in the first place just an everyday run of the mill manu messi h ter trynna slander probs has never watched a single ligue match outside of a few ucl everything he did here messi does way better and more consistently you re just proving his point how far ahead ballondor when v take those ronaldo ranked more times above messi golden boots ronaldo is top scorer in football history playmaker awards ronaldo was in uefa toty as mid times trophy with portugal he won if v ignr his ballondor for iniesta vvd lewa crazy definitely but how would they play together messi isn t the same player anymore he can t play on the wings the only thing this guy has above messi is goals and that s cause he has played far more games but penaldians won t see that dude messi spent years in laliga while ronaldo spent messi won the whole balon do r just from pr the whole balon they have spoilt messi messi had got a better goal do ur research before you reply did you even bothered to watch the game and if you did did you even bothered to focus on everything except neymar messi was the best player on the field was acting as the

match realmadrid manchester arsenal messi ronaldo cr football livepool barcelona premierleague my keyboard is showing favorite just saying messi didn t show up for training with barca in doesn t make him any less of a legend and the club were ok with him leaving some times players do try and force their ways out unless they do something terrible like move to a rival or upset their fans in some w carol messi fans who have nothing to enjoy messi gets compared to this guy technical ability he s miles behind messi not messi supposed to be aguero before messi psg lost ligue by that logic i think

won for copa win be messi it s clear as day media dickrides messi these guys are going to auction messi s ballon d or next if messi had sangho and rashford he d have more goals lol the reason he has less goals is because he assists the other two she s a but she no get yansh asuu messi infact he has more than messi ronaldo haaland de bruyne and virgil van dijk combined so of course he s now worth m lies this was when messi was kicked out of barcelona look at the date and shut up dont lie it took him around a week to get signed messi was kicked out and this was on you proved my point that y all

below hhayibo is messi holding a hubbly mouthpiece in years time ronaldo s legacy will be forgotten much like gerd muller and di stefano on the other hand messi will be regarded as the goat for generations just like how pele and maradona are remembered today j rgen klopp knows the path to recreate lionel messi at lfc as fsg must make transfer call messi damn dude you have really gone off the rails find a way to stay grounded gl which year was he better than messi he think he is doing like messi people will deadass watch shit like this and try to compare other footballers to him the gap between messi and everyone else is so huge these stats are misleading cristiano had games goals and assists which included multiple winners and hattricks on the other hand messi had games goals and

futebol tips casino bet betting gambling bahis sportsbetting tipster bettingtips tipico sbobet futbol melbet xbet betfair unibet sportwetten xbet cl ck here if you think about the grand scheme of football it s fucking shit that lionel messi had to leave barcelona him leaving definitely shouldn t of been the script hurt by benzema because messi missed easy penalties to coach the senior team he was given a huge amount to sign he said no went for messi busquet pedro thiago and his brother rafinha came up the following year christian tello kirck bojan isaac quenca ibrahim affelay i bet you don t even know dis players the way they celebrate ronaldo s wins is different from the way they celebrate messi s wins if a team is playing bad they always find a way to blame it on ronaldo but if messi isn t playing well they blame it on the team what people dont understand is that messi is more than one of the greatest goalscorers ever he is the greatest creator of our generation he will still influence games without goals messi has more haters than ronaldo that you should know the biggest difference is cr blows his own trumpet and calls himself king for mins of a pre season while messi quietly put on a clinic in a cup final the same day no fuss ogun frsc threatens reckless drivers deploys personnel eid il kabir news driver eid il kabir ogunfrsc bbnaija messi wizkid davido we can see the clear holes in our midfield and it was clearly evident in the first half besides verrati no one seems to know what to do how to create space our have any clear positional awareness all the elite club tend to dominate the midfield but its not the case here we ve been waiting first it was wait till messi is we ve been waiting and messi is still a baller you people don t get the point he s clearly saying the media favours messi more than ronaldo for no reason you can see the headlines and how they present them they paint messi differently and make ronaldo look like he s not do good or deserving of anything that he wins messi is the goat talkyourtalk messi not selling players griezmann m salary coutinho m m salary lenglet m salary umtiti m salary mingueza left messi left luuk de jong traor spotify deal m from levers b revenus m profit how about doing a research before talking as an honest messi fan this video proves me all wrong about ronaldo performance last season he did

barcelona prodigy better record than messi wonder goals and what he d offer hearts the scotsman when a coach starts messi or ronaldo he doesn t underestimate the opponent this is tinubu s number attack dog they are really scared of peter obi looks like labour party is the opposition and not pdp pedo messi paid the children messi is the goat talkyourtalk messi why m not able to see any comments like barca news he is not our player or these comments only appear when they post something about messi neymar has no influence over getting messi to vape if hes doing it its something hes

endsars messi asuu sabinus tinubu messi doesn t do this he actually progress the play sometimes he will pass pack if he doesn t have an option but in this situation he would turn and pick out one of his teammates hee s literally under no pressure scenes when ronaldo stays amp messi gets an all timer ucl campaign where he outscores ronaldo in the all timers list don t let that happen messi is the goat talkyourtalk messi even hardcore ronaldo fans know neymar has greater ability than ronaldo but for me messi is the undisputed goat mf what has messi done to ur standards he scored a tap in against fking bread makers and won tinpot trophies that have no value except to ur desperate ass his goal in the final vs germany is missing oh wait in all honesty cristiano messi benzema lewandowski and ibrahimovic are all outliers most footballers their age go to lower leagues such as mls saudi or qatar i would say mid s is the peak haaland and mbappe are going to be the new stars of the game so does messi doing useless one twos he s a striker playing back to goal in a unstructured system he s a false now who helps the team keep the ball end of the day he scores amp is involved in play effectively all i care about in this new position learn football messi robbed ney of the motm trophy yet his pr team will say otherwise anyways as ronaldo said the king played on sunday its funny how

i want a new challenge sorry messi but is our goat zamalek thats the tweet leo messi goat king nouveau psg women domicile messi au prix incroyable de verratti and messi seem to be bonding messi comes after ronaldinho overhyped youngsters from barca who think every player is messi bro go to dani alves twitter account and u will see that he quoted a tweet saying that messi is only trophies away from being the man with most trophies messi singlehandedly won barca the game at nou camp against liverpool they f ed up isnt up to him dont even talk about goals everytime ronaldo outscored messi the goalpost gets shifted meanwhile ronaldo is the greatest scorer in the history of the sport if messi had that title nobody will hear about ronaldo all the narratives that kept ronaldo in goat debate ballon d or messi has more golden boot messi has more most ucls players equaled it this year mr champions league took united to europa league mr challenger ran away from juve amp now utd factos no way messi has a disposable vape in his hand messi type numbers just reckless both ronaldo and messi last goals in laliga were headers cool messi rarely presses but when he does he gets the ball messi won

won internationally via goals assists ronaldo his g a directly contributed to of points his team won messi his g a directly contributed to of points his team won shut up when you dont know what you say the midfield was literally possessed by verrati and vitinha and was later reinforced physically by danilo bro cristiano playing in la liga for years and messi won more gold boots don t worry cristiano right now is the king of europa ligue isn t it crazy how lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo one time went against each other and ended up tying at the end of the match this just boosts their rivalry i met messi prime penaldo at vs finished messi luckily messi s goal to game ratio is much better then new season but players should stop doing too much party i care messi huge pr of messi no doubt forget ronaldo and messi this guy is the greatest footballer of all time even messi to psg didnt take this long internship certainly you will never be messi so does ronaldo tho and the only ones that matter are euro and world cup sooooo please tell me more and what r u talking about euro is superior then american football for god sakes messi is in the french league nothing more sad then that the undisputed goat is pel no ones come close actually after that messi is widely considered as better player than cristiano so cr s goat claims are lazy claims plus i will not sure if neymar was actually better in his peak than cristiano ronaldo maybe not exactly there is nothing to argue about ur just a deluded ronaldo fan in denial ever since messi won the copa america it s okay bro you ll get through it send me some cps in dms ronaldo plays the pl messi league in the world la king messi as a messi fan watching ronaldo is like watching porn can t understand why they hate ronaldo if they

record for most goals in football history and has a puskas award when was the last time messi scored a bicycle kick i ll wait not making it a competition but y all love to show your bias did he forget that when koeman asked for players it was bartomeu who denied him laporta barely took charge before the first window and had to sort out a literal mess and couldn t even keep messi on you all can t be serious u take a single photo add amp together come up with messi s never be a hard party er he doesn t like being up late amp likes to be up amp arrive early in the morning to things kun has said

watched ronaldo ghost for minutes against rayo and his replacement score a goal in minutes then he shows his current team disrespect by leaving early meanwhile messi gets booed by psg fans and comes back just to score a goal in a cup final and win you can t say you ve never tried to be the best then put in the hours in training and on the pitch to help your team succeed it just pushes the dumb narrative that messi is all talent and no hard work he s of course he s declined messi is scoring goals in ligue so he s declined way more oh ffs the golden ball was his how disgusting they gave it to messi the last goal of messi vs real madrid came from a foul of luis suarez if clubs are important then why messi flops in psg the fact is cristiano can score anywhere everywhere and messi needs ronaldinho xavi iniesta puyol to pamper they not wrong tho messi is a system player because he is the system most intelligent messi fan account dawg is like i m the only person that uses psg and build up play and try to score good goals man dem just swing to neymar messi and of course mbappe and run just run run run the l all he did was run and cross and get rebounds tsk messi is the goat

better for them not to slander messi for fati s failures you can t deny that tho right messi has been on a decline for years barca had half of the spain team messi is washed and thats he had to go to psg bcuz the team who carried him have all parted ways with barca btw if canada beat half the teams he beat in copa i feel bad for u un eu react to attack on odessa s port after grain deal war news eu odessa un war bbnaija messi wizkid davido benzema is better than henry who got carried to a ucl title by messi i m not buying this look at the ratio of these extreme fans to the ones that hate him the hatred overwhelms the support completely also if we rated players based on fanbases no one would like leo messi messi will come back definitely it s all about bartomeu but not messi who wanted contract extension every year to increase his wages you implied it you are suggesting that zlatan being a big number is why pep didnt want him and he will fail with haaland for that reason thats not the reason the reason is zlatan is an arrogant bellend and pep preferred messi which proves hes smart dont try and backtrack quand nabil djellit agresse messi when did i say this but atleast he has carried his team to those many finals what about pendu argentina wouldn t even have made to those finals without messi ironic messi met ronaldo in the champions league final and semi final ronaldo ghosted both times while messi his rival scored three of the most legendary goals ever all to win the game ronaldo has also missed more important penalties in the cl lmao messi can t even get antonella pregnant without help of sep blatter no amount of tears will change the fact that messi has international trophies and ronaldo will flop in south america football there is nothing u can bout but cry sadly dumbass gavin thinking he is saying something smart professional players world cup winners think ronaldo is the best ever messi played in a system made for him with probably best midfielders ever messi is great at barca only cr everywhere idk who needs to hear this but if you had to wait until messi was to say he s not the goat than u need to pick another sport if your mom gets pregnant you ll blame messi for it ngl its bringing some memories to play with messi and dinho yeah but teams don t pick u bc of your bal n does they pick you on your performance rn and messi not doing good plus that trophy means nothing it s gamers league tell yourself that ronaldo had to adapt to a new team and a new country while messi was there for years its okay messi fans are delusional u ain t gotta explain to them they re age range is to anyone older knows ronaldo and ronaldinho are one of a kind you are the one who is crying rn pipe down we are talking abt lingard and you are are trying to sneak in messi we won t buy i am happy messi and neymar will ball this season way too player i be kickin shit like messi lol pessi fans got hurt by benzema so much because messi missed easy penalties so they pretend to be benzema fans because of ronaldo as you can see almost every season messi played more laliga matches so i didn t put on the golden boot logic but in liga ronaldo had better stats and in ucl i don t even need to talk but that was two monsters my god messi fans are delusional ronaldo has been relevant before man u and messi just became relevant the past years maybe even less i understand the frustration from both of you guys but let s stop it here we all rate ansu and messi there s no point in arguing everyone s got their own opinion so just agree to disagree and move on this is to both of you offside goals won t count lewandowski alone scored goals against your hyped team with a team like dortmund check the data on zackrawr or the sullygnome for asmon when he plays in the past months lol he will retire with more champions leagues than maradona and r combined more international trophies than messi and cristiano combined more domestic titles than puyol and ramos combined messi has won trophies this year though can t say the same for cr sangah is pitching for his favorite baseball team shinwon is modeling for his favorite juice minhyuk s song got noticed by messi poor hyunsik can t go to the moon messi wouldn t make ten back passes in a row domestic cups can also be based on route as well look at ronaldo s fa cup and league cup routes vs some of messi s copa del rey routes it does matter when comparing the same standard of competition across countries or continents to compare the route difficulty achievement etoo messi iniesta ronaldinho were made by frank rijkaard and not gardiola and barcelona were charpions on comparing urself to messi lol joker if messi wasn t taking more wage than entire liverpool squad combined you could ve afford a good cb pair admin is defs a messi fan it s going to be a long long season here for it not audi lmao but what he said makes sense so for continental international competitions messi s copa vs uruguay brazil colombia chile ecuador bolivia paraguay ronaldo s euros was wales hungary iceland austria croatia poland france messi was clearly better i hate it when i see a tweet with no relation to ronaldo or messi being related to them like bruh just enjoy the football if messi had a cb pairing of araujo kounde and a good poacher we would ve won ucl suarez declined by then and

pedro average pass me some of that shit you re smoking the biggest gap between them after their football ability is how ronaldo manages to embarrass himself constantly while messi keeps to himself and isn t an egotistic maniac messi play makes in friendly too mate ronaldo fans can t accept messi isn t a limited goalscorer like ronaldo dawg he s a midfielder now he s only jealous of messi cuz his idol ain t winning trophies been biased with cr but nah messi all around player messi fans talking about statpadding lmao typical messi fans watch this that s the problem we shouldn t have targeted waiting till end of window for anyone no player is worth that as you have seen with ronaldo and messi just be quick and precise in the window and close deals off target taking time move to target his work is that haaland is a scorer he doesn t need all round game like ur own words messi doesn t need headers looks like messi is kwat this season i sense something special coming can messi score runs for the last wicket in an ashes match yea i don t think so how ironic your idol nowhere near like maradona play even at his prime while messi is everyday what maradona play lol for years what a clown don t even watch matches he is bruhh this is not his playstyle you are a messi fan what can we expect from you keep hating aren t time zones amazing in australia its tomorrow in europe it s today in america it s yesterday and in messi fans mind it s still hate against cr is on another level he didn t even mean to say this phrase against messi yet you guys used it argentina may go the final and win once and for all for the name of falkland i love to watch messi play whenever plays only one one playmaker and you see argentina will be heading to to final like how z zidane maradona johan cruyff play as lone playmaker maguire scored more own goals than messi scored league goals last season messi can do cricket but ben stokes can t dribble past players and score bro doesn t understand that adidas not messi arranged and conceptualized that photoshoot lol messi does this in ucl games he needs to win i think messi has finally settled down at psg they should disappear pep and messi are major part of barca history and even if they go to enyimba of aba we ll support them leo messi s last ever goal for barca was a header players with the most goals in major final messi goals pele goals neymar goals with only yrs of ucl career vini has the same number of ucl final winners as messi s nvr ronaldo gt gt gt messi in football messi gt ronaldo in dribbling obviously david villa scored goals for barca so messi has scored more than pedro suarez villa neymar and sanchez combined might include zlatan also since i m pretty sure he didn t score goals don t act like the media didn t slander messi all second half of last season lmao vinicius is better at football than haaland and messi is better at football than ronaldo tweet more messi imo he d dominate cricket too messi has struggled in france first season in a new league can be a struggle jude is one of the best youngsters in the world and that why so many want him don t be so cheap for money if you want to praise messi just do it basically your whole page is based on praising messi and making people fool stop this nonsense and learn to give respect you re still in my heart messi messi has more el clasico goals than vini have career goals lmao messi choosing or your fu king presidents are responsible are he choose psg i bet on messi ronaldo fans called for my head when he missed that pen in champs leo messi has more goals for fc barcelona than luis suarez neymar jr pedro and alexis sanchez combined it s almost as if psg prefer to be a brand than a actual football club i don t even watch them play but the only reason they popped out on my feed was because ramos and messi were holding a trophy together like seriously wtf is that frenkie fc is s ck man he isnt even near rakitics legacy at barca they treat him like messi false reports and no he didn t again this media has u fooled to thinking messi is the goat stop believing the internet no because messi is a way better footballer spain is notoriously strict on tax look at messi ronaldo mourinho and guardiola all convicted of tax evasion carried messi ghost messi keep crying messi messi s finished tho beautiful if true messi the goat the king so wonderful to be your fan talking about messi he is one of the reasons he stayed at psg messi sent suarez a special message that was played during his nacional unveiling how many players have been compared to messi again messi is now the s i unit for measuring players abilities so courtois did nothing and is useless got it you don t treat your own players very well do you giving him credit for that save just so you can slander messi just the kind of sad behavior i d expect from a madrid fans that s really more of a ronaldo fanboy leo messi goat if we swap messi and mbappe in that game and play messi a bit lower we win by so many passes were accurate but needed some extra pace only one goal deprived messi of this how many goals deprived ronaldo of penaldo commented factos two jealous sunday the king plays etc amp obsession towards messi if you can t give decent performance even after crying like a little bitch on social media then you are just attention seeker then surely ronaldo is thrice the player messi is as he won ucl being the main man of the team nah cristiano got equally good or even better pr without these hype he is not even fit to clean messi s boot his fans just highlighting whenever he s not recieving the praises hypocrite fanbase amp bunch of crybabies i love messi but he shouldn t make the list messi is good in dribbling but when it comes to skill replace him with neymar jr messi wants to arrive on world cup in top condition and already told his father he doesn t want anything to distract him before the world cup he will decide in january february messi and xavi are in constant contact fcb psg transfers fabrizio romano xavi and laporta are dreaming of leo messi s return in ey are planning to make first call in coming months on the

ronaldo despite playing more finals now you stfu ratio i ve been in a coma since has my idol messi scored in a ucl final since then could you please let me know am still wondering how messi became the man of the match when neymar scored and assisted one g o a t personally the only one that generates off the pitch is messi you can t beat his type of marketing and neymar s to a certain extent you can t expect to be viewed a serious when in the pitch but they fail year after year even with this out of prime big names too bad ronaldo didnt get a shot on target in his ucl final against messi messi couldn t reach a ucl final even with msn and a barcelona superteam in and bottled again in and and we cant forget where he had goals and couldn t turn up in the semi final vs chelsea also and bottled with xavi and iniesta man s been dickriding guardiola so much for clout messi never chose to play for psg it was psg who acted swiftly and the only clubwho agreed to pay his wages the club that you dick ride so much had already gotten a mil grealish i ve came to the realization i ve been blinded for so long messi is the real not near he was better actually now show me a stat where messi is better or near to ronaldo at heading and areal duel win and i will withdraw me from this debate good morning culers say it back if u think messi is the goat messi carried by teammates ten hag tells

shoes laura messi camel brown ebay i assume you are a kid born this year as if you were born before you would have seen messi s previous goals or else you just started watching football this year because he know the barca multiverse penaldo is also a pedophile the girl said messi didn t date her lmao ney messi and mbappe are not the problems they may have high ass wages but they generate so much other things in return it s mostly the players who don t play which piss me off they aint racist to indians they just dead naming indian names because most of messi fans in twitter are indians even before the injury his dribbling wasn t anywhere near messi barca vs madrid without suarez and messi sooo and btw that was and suarez played and scored a hattrick ronaldo fans should be thankful of media they are the only ones who made it a debate messi is astronomically clear when did statue get injured who s the guy on barca messi alba pique messi the real but cr is better than messi bla bla blaa there things are certain in life death taxes and espn sucking off messi and all this he still doesn t owe more ballon dors and golden boots than messi sad messi is a big game player though the solely means barcelona can re sign lionel messi from psg this is why lionel messi is the greatest of all time i slander it because its uber eats regardless of whether messi played or not that s not an opinion that s a fact if you win trophies every season for the next seasons you ll still have lesser trophies than messi and dani alves ronaldo in a final so what messi s game is based on dribbles ronaldos game is based on draw back defenders and break the defence its not necessary for him to dribbles always work smarter not harder messi is apparently in his playmaking prime but he s statistically not even clear of neymar and mbappe the best i ve seen is xavi is xavi and so is third yes messi what s wrong with my prediction messi closer and closer to alves record of player with most trophies pedri lives in their minds rent free and just like messi has been the si unit to rate players in the last decade pedri is gonna be one for the next decade name erling haaland body zlatan

bedtime stories for children murder betrayal stupidity courage patience aesop fable suntzu artofwar golf ancient conflict messi ramos morrison westworld every time i need messi highlights im so confused in how anyone else could be considered the take messi out of the games he played in and barca would still have won the ucl that season not true all at their whole argument stands on the

now messi and his pr s fault that he played well scored and won a trophy on the same sunday when the their self obsessed idol announced sunday the king plays and ghosted imagine my shock none of those guys are an yo messi the worst type of sports fan messi ronaldo fanboys verstappen hamilton fanboys wanna bet i m guessing messi will get most pre assists at best and some good amount of goals and

messis first ucl without them bayern wouldnt have advanced to the quarters messi is better in every aspect other than heading messi has literally won it you re an indispensable political leader dogara

rono is really a great player and had messi not been there he would have been the best player but there s no comparison between him and messi could be an unstoppable force but then i want messi to score or assist more in the trio messi is huge in asia europe latin america africa he is also pretty known in the us i don t know about middle eastern countries tho what choices did they have la liga rules force every number to be used up till or some bs like that unless you wanted coutinho with ansu was the only realistic option and people think hes goin to be the new messi without letting start his own career with we witnessed painful ucl humiliations koeman sold luis su rez to atletico de madrid we lost leo messi for financial mismanagement wtf did i just write his distribution is nowhere near as good as ter statues tho maybe it ll improve woth hametime was good for yrs too if i say messi was nvr good at heading and areal duels won then it s ok absolutely how could messi comment something like that when he doesn t know english make sure you dont choke on all that messi dick your sucking messi has fallen off a bit he s still great but no where near the player he was seasons ago its same as fa cup comp wise also players like drogba as mrfinal is myth drogba only have one intecontinental goal contribution where messi have in ucl usc cwc intl comps etc he has more ucl goals because he has played more matches messi s goal scoring ratio and g a ration are better than rono cam phillipe coutinho rw messi or bowen xavi messi deserves one last chance to show that he can leave the club well if the question is whether i would like him to come back the answer is a resounding yes although today he has a contract source messi fcblive fcbarcelona messi thank you so much icon christophe galtier might become the best coach psg have had in many years messi and neymar both look good under him and although it s just preseason it looks very much promising messi isn t always the

do messi has in argentina just when messi wears it nah but they need to think for the future messi isn t gonna get any younger do you know how good arnaus distribution and shot stopping is i wouldn t be surprised if francefootball gave it away to messi again for being humble and dribbling and giving the ball away obviously since he plays in france which is outside the top leagues as well well deserved yeah eriksen played against am with good performance after not playing for a long time and still deliver against rv but yeah ronaldo ghosted because he didn t play for month and whose fault is that sunday the king play only for ronaldo ghosted and messi scoring oooh please if it was messi you wouldn t care if he played under yr olds was it in the final asks shamefully mann neymar will turn messi into a party animal as well messi wears i have seen this film so many times but messi has neymar and mbappe on his side only breaking just now messi was willfully refined by a devoted brown booby while eating a corrugated fiberboard news breaking at messi will be in mls is there any rule like if you like ronaldo then you have to hate messi if this is your philosophy then grow up people

king by others real difference neither can messi the fact he didnt get into farmers tots while ronaldo got into the tots of the hardest league says enough unfortunately messi doesn t get qualifiers to statpad against lithuania and luxembourg scoring in a friendly against brazil is harder than scoring in a competitive game against luxembourg isn t it pendu was playing in the same league btw why couldn t he match messi for argentina even now messi is really good he just doesn t give his while playing for psg talking about big games and goal ratios goals against epl top which i think you consider as the best league itw messi games goals assists g a ratio tapinaldo games goals assists g a ratio messi without playing in the epl has a better record the way they treated messi and he

instagram twitter johan cruyff maradona messi all have lost a world cup final cristiano ronaldo has never lost a world cup final goat suiiiiiiii ahahahha messi lovers are very rare as fressi did not come out as a scorer or assister now they will say that he was the best because he gave more passes to the side or because he looked more at the grass always measuring fressi with the stick that suits him best the marketing you just forget messi ronaldo and messi are good friends but fans are proving themselves as stupid yh but ronaldo isn t that bad at dribble like messi is bad at heading or areal duel winning social media is the only reason ronaldo gets compared to messi it s just funny how messi fans want to call messi everything ronaldo calls himself the god of football the best the goat now the king if ronaldo calls himself the kangaroo they ll say messi has been hopping since birth obsessed fc messi has more goals against the top en ronaldo does and he never played in the pl but messi couldn t do it in the prem right thats such an old and non true argument against messi if ronaldo rlly dominated la liga like you implying why d messi get more golden boots man y all take screenshots of when they are praising messi while all media sites praise and criticize both messi and ronaldo so stop being childish ffs wow imagine comparing stats between the french league and the premier

i don t see messi he s shamelessly ghosting again if messi has been able to score against the top six teams in epl who are the rest of the epl teams that he can t score against you including argentina now but yall acting like yall weren t praising the teammates for saying that they only want to win copa america for messi but whatever and he s probably earning more than messi at his age i sure hope he lives up to all the hype and silence all doubters like us overall messi has a better ratio and guess who played in a farmer s league in portugal and guess who started his career years ahead if messi is that a vape in messi s hands you clown of those are friendly for messi better than messi try watch how messi score his goals he doesn t care if u give him space or not haan tabhi toh hum add

are just numbers to win the match when people say ronaldo is the most complete player of all time they laugh kids have never seen cr from beginning so it s ok even though ronaldo is better i still respect messi for what he s done and who he is the ndgoat who is goat yes messi koeman signed luke and couldn t even make good use of him don t defend koeman bro stop it sucks koeman had the likes of messi greizman and co and still bottled the league the team had no identity under koeman never proven but messi hating black people is proven don t compare a goat with a so called beast we all know

messi in football terms is just delusional this is just a strategy to be in news and in good thoughts of fans the last time laporta said he ll do anything to keep messi he went to psg oh my god he literally doesn t start over anyone he s our biggest brand no mate we have pedri and lewandowski now we are probably also getting messi back next summer you know whats funny even if messi wins the

ligue goals bottled the ucl bottled the french cup missed crucial pen vs madrid uncountable misses ligue toty ligue flop of the year missing on s vs lorient ghosting vs ligue farmers finished player no messi no like they both played amazing but messi has more impact on the pitch if it weren t for the set pieces neymar wouldn t have scored but would ve had a big game tho imagine this world cup final portugal argentina qatar world cup cristianoronaldo ronaldo cr messi portugal worldcupqatar they both played amazing but messi has more impact on the pitch if it weren t for the set pieces neymar wouldn t have scored but would ve had a big game tho due to messi being better the saddest day of my life will be when messi plays his last match yeah he is the goat so it was easy after getting blamed for losing international finals even after being man of the tournaments and getting blamed for ucl blunders for team s defence conceding easy goals despite messi being highest rated player what an easy downwards messi played far less games no we don t need messi anymore messi has a good heart and all but man that security is that supposed to be messi the goat messi tf is feel more ironic are you dumb or what just checked your profile you are a messi fan sure you have less iq you don t even know this what you are talking feels more iconic una messi needs to retire too brother it doesn t care what messi is doing he could win his ballond or score goals but the haters still will find reasons from the moon why he isn t the goat in their eyes for me he s already the goat und should be for everyone with junior abdirahman for soccer practice they are calling him little messi it wasn t assist but a deflection which messi used properly fact if ramos took that penalty he would have goals and u would cry ramos deserve motm because he have goals penaldians should stop assessing things with scoresheet and strat to watch actual games goats are short giraffes are tall messi is goat ronaldo is a giraffe can messi score goals this season thats a pr channel of messi lo celso isnt argentinian winks he shines in argentina squad messi wants him in the squad he was top in villareal lionel messi to win ballon d or messi ran to a complete team ronaldo went to a dying team it s a miracle he has g a bro im a messi fan but dont do this he should be in contention for o for how his form is looking hes a messi fan ronaldo please forgive me for sharing messi highlights but it s really just psg highlights one is crying because he missed a penalty which could ve won his country a ucl the other is simply staring at messi keep linking that image to embarrass yourself people talk too much neymar slams messi critics messi literally from a spanish speaking country the illusion that he s anywhere close to messi is caused by the fact that they play at the same time that s it i literally cannot remember someone saying messi was world class last season the soccer teams owned by saudi arabia qatar etc are all the biggest budget teams buying away the best players think leo messi to psg all for the same reason sportswashing you think abu dhabi cares if they lose money on owning man city most motm in wc dude messi won the mvp in wc espn how much u love to talk about messi and ronaldo so people can watch u guys pethacic even if messi wasn t there at psg they would ve won the domestic trophies anyways like they always did messi make no differences to psg look what happened in ucl last season lol messi played for the champions of france last season his goal assist was ronaldo played for a poor performing united messi spent his entire life at his comfort zone in barcelona i m not trying to take anything from him messi is one of the best players in the world no player has traumatised a fanbase the way ronaldo has traumatised messi fc amp barca fans espn particularly spreads fake news in both ways gasing up messi s pr and degrading cristiano purposefully i have never seen ronaldo run past players including the gk in a final an score like messi did against bilbao best ever i think this year is one of the only years where everyone agrees who will win the ballan dor and its obviously messi benzema wait why are messi fans trolling martinez they are teammates if u really deep it messi is the best in the msn trio what are u trying to say bro none of these messi proclaim himself as a king or goat some of these just commercial why always so hard to you guys to understand my god ronaldo commented factos sunday king plays liking a post slandered messi etc crazy terrorists who ambushed soldiers in abuja neutralised dhq claims news bernardonyeuko terrorists bbnaija messi wizkid davido messi is the best player ever to play the game natural talent ronaldo worked hard to get to his level messi was just born with it why everyone liked barca back in the day joy to watch bro think she messi the only way barcelona can re sign lionel messi from psg the biggest gap between ronaldo and messi has never been their football ability it s the pr they receive this is so weird he s when we were judging messi and ronaldo they were in their primes anyways ur boring go and google some stats between the head to head clearly ur new haven t seen his facade during el classico matches against messi got owned several times even you know the ronaldo messi debate is one that would last a millennium i blame lionel messi yeah that is true i remember pep bought puyol messi xavi bosquets iniesta and valdes well the hardest part is that they don t do it in barcelona and let the culture and throne passed down to next generation at where it was started and it sad that messi wouldn t have the chance to bring his last ucl home in barcelona as his last tribute true this is why ronaldo gt messi messi was what bro think he messi ney ou messi seein what messi does to neymar in psg is like what ronaldinho did to him in barcelona ending his own time and start giving up his throne to another mega star not every legend can do that name erling haaland body zlatan hairstyle andy carroll hype ronaldo expectation lewandowski predicted performance messi reality lukaku with a little touch of yakubu spiced with timo werner amp flavoured with a little touch of benteke having maguire s mentality messi peaked higher ronaldo better average was better in their young years and is better now but messi was better in their prime literally there are pages created to talk about messi so stop crying skinny you man seein that dajjal eye on messi s that s why cr e goat thank you messi is not as good as messi correct cuz he s s just u lot not choosing to accept the fact that messi is far better than your guy make una open una eyes na i actually love messi messi has as many goals in finals as he does finals messi never played in epl but he has considerably high number of goals against the big boys from england so you think his problem will be qpr you re the greatest clown in the multiverse then why are you lot so bothered with what messi fans tweet about penlado moreover why penlado bothered to tweet messages like king is playing factos robbery and essays about his sorry life the only player more active on twitter than on field messi forgot that that man use to break them most goals in finals messi goals pele goals neymar goals messi played finals in he was awarded motm in both games big game player haaland struggles in first full game and the pundits want to crucify him relax did ronaldo or messi have a bad hair day did pele or cruyff give the kid a break wait until he s or and then you can complain find something else to talk about alexis sanchez is set to join ligue club marseille another finished player like messi is joining the french farmers league transfers transfernews psg without messi place lose french supercup psg with messi league champions win french supercup man utd without ronaldo place man utd with ronaldo place medford messi is about to do rounds in the prem im telling you so excited for this as a usmnt fan not excited for this as a chelsea fan this guy is better than messi people do not know they are supposed to respect politics the same way they respect further maths that s why we ll continue failing as a nation cos we insist on wrong calculation comparing obi to tinubu is like comparing vini jr to messi who would let a club take m and cut his wages grow up messi is at psg boi it was such a great goal by messi hopefully he will have a great season in which was year ago messi broke most goals in calender year record he won ligue just this year won ucl exactly years ago so are you making sense at all you are not a messi fan you re just a cr hater your profile says it all what a cringe thing lmao all you do is talk shit about cr fu and just say he s huge stats can t lie messi is huge cr is huge pele was huge etc don t talk shit just appreciate the game kiddo shove your opinions down your arse little kid the convo was about ronaldo having poor playmaking skills and not a ronaldo vs messi contest ronaldo s playmaking was much better during his younger days with alex ferguson now he is just as finished as messi i used to respect the hell out of barca for no shirt sponsor then unicef this is really a shame awful look not having to sell messi bad but how is his favorite athletes lionel messi and he doesn t watch football the math isn t computing lol bro literally ur tweet doesnt make sense u are comparing a defender to messi and ronaldo grow uppp think before u talk nonsense no shit anyone with a working brain knows he isn t anywhere near as good as messi the media made you believe they are and of all time nonsense best ever goal scorer yet outscored messi times in years messi switched account to espnfc this dude said messi doesn t have creative dribbling i m a madrid fan and even i know that s wrong lol he s got a jackass look like he did it all after his teammates carried him look at messi to contrast hakimi hasn t too but it s not the same as messi why how is he bad i dont know his coaching style so please explain how hes worse than poch when messi could finish yes because we could ve obviously afforded messi s m a year wage cut sergi roberto is on very very low wage and pique is probably goin to retire soon ferran has brilliant movement and will be the best partner for lewandowski memphis cant score open play goals he aint a when ronaldo was messi won his d or when messi was messi won his d or messi is the goat noble gesture messi fulfilled the dream of a fanatic child and behaved like a true idol video i now have power to demolish houses harbouring cultists gov abiodun news abiodun bbnaija messi wizkid davido and how many did messi scored actually woman instead of calculating g a go in the kitchen and count how many cucumber left in the fridge that s much more helpful ohh messi cs download music mp stone banks emi lo kan music music stonebanks downloadpage bbnaija messi wizkid davido there is no agreed upon truth and law that says if messi wins football wins messi is like any player he was not born to deserve everything what is happening is just propaganda from messi fc to sympathize with whatever messi achieves in return discrediting other players these big games are the finalissima and french yes french supercup i honestly can t tell the difference between ronaldo accounts trolling and proud messi accounts anymore out of messi iniesta ribery ronaldo modric van dijk lewandowski and jorginho he s the weakest player on the list everybody that says r are messi fan boy look man messi is simply better than cr has better ga ratio more ballon dore has better record head to head just check the el classico records or united vs barca cl finals has more trophies than him and this is a guy who is short footed no heading ability hey i have something to say we don t give a fuck cause in fact messi is a goat of football not of vitality nor of csgo so it has nothing to do with it idk that s messi or alba salary hw much madrid wished messi on father s day and there is real madrid s father if you seriously think that ronaldo have even half of messi s footballing ability then you are just living in denial or you re just delusional messi has called himself lion and kings severally i got messi people who hate on messi people who hate on ronaldo people who love both before signing ronaldo jj didn t win italian supercup since then it doesn t matter cuz without ronaldo jj already won everyting before signing messi psg won french supercup since in a row now leo made it possible the goat hypocrisy another messi fan spreading lies fati is better than messi messi has never done it in the prem ronaldo is highest goalscorer in the prem at years old only behind salah and son who are in better teams and in their primes tell me i m wrong goals goat worst argument of all is that he could score as much or even more than messi in pep s system fati took messi s number and flopped messi is the one who has the most pr and ronaldo is the more hated one messi better calling yourself as madrid fan and having entire account just to hate him your last tweet have madrid prop it s all sucking off messi and hating on madrid club legend you really think people are idiot that they won t know who you support huh a ronaldo fan boy would do anything to defend their ram that s why the f went to my profile to see if he had something to slander me with you can t accept the fact that ronaldo is no where close to what he was years ago nor close to a finished messi s playmaking ability messi slander always welcome messi brings more money you casual go educate yourself is lionel messi the football ghost yes absolutely ofcourse official dj penaldo playlist i m a fraud i need u ft kroos amp modric thank you eder rejected again new challenge ft europa league living in the box ft penalty spot goat ft messi give me luxembourg viva las vegas ft kathryn mayorga messi is better tho gt ronaldo ego is too large to only be second best so it s fun to shove his face in the dirt a new record messi has now scored goals in finals matches that means a new world record he surpasses the brazilian legend pel who had scored goals in finals simply messi should messi win another corrupt ballon d or for being ligue flop of the season be honest ballondor lm lionel messi s chapter at barcelona is now now not over president joan laporta football ability can t tell me with a straight face ronaldo has more football ability than messi

best league in the world i m sorry but there s no comparison cr is the lwitter again fucking messi s fault says a coach who called messi a god wont bring back messi s btw i like ronaldo when he was at real madrid because of the competition he put against barca and laliga and messi it was a nice competition i didnt mind him in juventus but i despise him at man u because i hate that fucking team its terrible in all aspects of football lewandowski was outperforming messi and ronaldo but our board was letting his contract run down they lied to him saying they wouldn t go for haaland then did behind his back kahn and brazzo together aren t even half the man lewy is is that why he has the worst conversation rate in europe and why u gone lie to praise messi he is not even top he was great against spurs even tho he didn t complete many dribbles yh i know messi alsi gets hated on all players have there turns im just saying ronaldo own is worse that even when he wins he is not acknowledge enough

be as big of a waste as messi choosing to play with farmers was considering the fact that he never did this too messi was never that smart either again you ve selected a few it means nothing i just said era will have influence i m telling you messi club career is unrivalled cr is close pele is nowhere in club comparison played friendlies for santos btw ronaldinho buffon maldini just a few saying messi srry he was good enough at the age of to play for barca srry he s naturally skilled at the sport i m srry messi is the goat wtf y all reaching hard ronaldo fans can t sleep because of messi messi playing i don t rep messi only arsene wenger has watched pele lmaoo forgot to add van basten too he said messi is not even close to him this is fact cause if you know ball and just use your eyes you can clearly see messi and cr was never close and was it even messi s fault that he left key in ass messi where s messi yeah just saw it glad why messi what are you talking about aston in their years of existence or are you taking into account their force india dans caus if so then that team doesn t give a single fuck bout their drivers most clutch version of messi yes i can name loads in this era who say messi what s your point guardiola klopp wenger etc rare l from a fellow chelsea fan messi is clear of ronaldo hamilton gt the red bull franchise don t get on pique s bad side or you ll get messi d or shakira d by the spanish government cos they are filled with messi fans i can kinda see it but not rly ppl in the comments talkin bout messi lmfaooo he wants to play with messi his idol forget him so is neymar and messi and ronaldo definitely footballing ability because messi is unbelievably clear you might just be my hater so messi owns the media just rest man you have no point in that also last season when messi missed the pen vs real and ronaldo ended up scoring vs brighton a few minutes later i don t believe in god but this has to be divine intervention the only way barcelona can re sign lionel messi from psg i ve been saying this for a while ronaldo got the big game persona during the threepeat when he had less playmaking and dribbling responsibilities from messi was so clear in big games everytime i see these types of tweets i thank god that i am a messi fan summoner war is better than messi i guess the group would be empty then or its messi and neymar and mbappe fans in it you remove messi s dribbling and you still have a world class finisher playmaker assist provider you remove cr s finishing and you get a benteke with nice eyebrows all hail the investooorrrr messi s manifesting again isn t he it was just an example the only reason he is in the goat debate is because he is constantly getting compared to messi by media for years i support real madrid since and there wasn t a moment in which he was above messi and i ve witnessed his prime years beat da pussy up it got messi soccer first game of the season and first title for paris saint germain as psg beat nantes in the french super cup to win the championship with goals from lionel messi sergio ramos and a brace from neymar ratio yourself a lfc fan and messi fan and psg fan and barca fan are you that guy in fifa that cheers for every team i had never seen a hate coming through messi s way like the way cristiano ronaldo is hated even last season messi s worst season he was pampered like a child but not a single hate man cristiano ronaldo i love that ronaldo has upset scum fans and now they re finally admitting messi is the goat ronaldo won euro july messi won copa america july it s scary at this point mbappe scores more when messi is on the pitch it s not just about goals if you disagree you re fucking stupid messi gt i would empty my bank account to be go back years to watch a few matches of prime ronaldo and messi hope that stays the same did messi ever do this messi is finished nah bruh at this point activate lever amp to bring back messi typical stupidity of a messi stan you lot and ronnie fangirls i don t even know who s more abnoxious at this point they don t call him the parklea messi for nothing messi goals recap from the championship game courtesy of psg goal tigerchampsnft psgchou lotta fans questioned why he was sold for so much money he may not meet these high expectations but i also feel like he is being slept on the medford messi is a baller no no levels and levels in this sport pel already at yo was better than peak neymar neymar never reached r s level and r had years old in this period he never reached the consistency of messi also not the highest peak of maradona in cruyff etc etc maybe we win the final at wembley if we don t play against this version of messi this and the fact that both their older kids have the same ish day gap between their birthday shows how connected ronaldo and messi actually are please are u guys messi fan or j guys are promoting sports i still know my goat he s vs everybody messi has been pampered crazy goat messi yeah coz messi is more than goalscorer he s ranks higher than thiago in progressive paases ranks higher than kdb in ball carries ranks higher then modric in chances created had more throughballs and dribbles than any other player had more touches than anyone in final just league goals for psg was this the worst season in lionel messi s career a normal routine for some celebrities not really surprised l messi was in dah same shitty story sometime ago ronaldo never stayed in club for so long yet he has better wining percentage as a captain than messi in club level got to be the best version of messi he had football in a chokehold from the to no footballer came close to the performances he had not even leo messi let s be serious public figures people can take videos amp pictures of them wherever they are seen hope you see how random people post random pictures of rihanna ronaldo messi amp many other foreign celebrities or don t you see how cameramen rush to take shots of top influencers public figure didn t know it was such uncommon knowledge that messi is the king no because i m a convinced i will never love a guy as much as i love messi loml fr none of them alive what you on about or about messi has matched pele in terms of dominating an era fact he s better than messi notice how messi isn t here lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time messi or neymar trophy pics i m leaving with something regardless never comparable like comparing messi to the great mario kempas of argentina or like comparing cr to rui costa look who copied who who watched who and kearnd their skill and traits the great players where seen great at their very early years of fb at yrs remove messi s goals so messi is clear but ms waka waka gotta pay as a fellow man city fan since elanga is needed in the team we are missing that power hunger and fight esp all these years in the ucl elanga is also a black messi regen who would take our squad up max with his incredible gemerational talent elangain who says no messi your not better than ronaldo l loser di maria got subbed off in finalissima you daft fuck messi had asssits and dominated the game martinez was closest to messi not do maria anyhow hidden agenda from you ronnie sad acts again he s gonna find those clips where messi would pass to xavi or insista but it would actually be to mess with the players and get them impatient bro shut up u are a hater that s all you are lol zlatan is not even at the level to be compared to ronaldo you lots be chatting shit these days it s like you are all waiting for him to fail so bad if he had the season messi had last season u hater will drag his ass who will win thee premier league this season premier league epl burnaboy wizkid davido messi soldout wike rashford england chelsea arsenal man united man city liverpool leichester depayb dont be afraid about us we have te best crowd ever and one big and piola stadium idk ask coldplay messi dulce de leche mate recoleta carpinchos capybaras very good ice cream and meat come on come to argentina bue bornpink blackpink i have been hearing that social media pays fb ig twitter all pays messi and other celebrities but since i opened mine they never ask for my account number hmm hard cristiano ronaldo is the most overrated player in history in terms of him being compared to messi yeah you need to watch the game fam one goal was a penalty messi was at the heart of all moves chances created and if others could finish would of had a couple assists to his name he scored the important opener neymar pass for asssits was deflection the biggest rivalry isn t ronaldo and messi rather ronaldo vs the world u really don t understand that messi coming back is about money messi can bring us money for rb and busi replacement in one day football is not by numbers sha but you watch messi and you still see the difference messi is still the best itw change your avi to messi nothing to waste time on suspended sentence just like ronaldo and messi yawn i d do anything for a messi knee slide yes they ll always be a majority owner same with blm b is valued at m so m for bit they also wnat to grow that into making more yearly they d rather sell b meat year as they fell with messi i d be valued at m m for this is such a shit take i think messi is the better footballer but cristiano was on the same level as messi and in some years he was a better player than messi his level only really dropped in the last few years which is natural considering his age no i mean play the brand of football he played while winning coaching that team to that level beating ur boy sir alex s united twice while doing that in the cchampions league final getting messi to play his best ever football and also revolutionize the game completely he thinks he s messi my idol pendu is so finished and still got outscored by messi where was messi when psg team mates celebrated ramos back heel goal or he was dissappear because he knew that ramos will celebrate his goal with ronaldos siuuuu that s cause messi actually spends time working amp ballin not tweeting amp giving himself self proclaimed titles u sure about that now bring out where the same media slanders messi or the tactics now is sympathy summer lionel messi summer kylian mbappe summer reece james summer karim adeyemi in this order messi won t do that cos that s not play making is there a way to mute messi and ronaldo stans on twitter they ruin every soccer post pessi penaldo donnarumma wasn t up to when he became ac milan s first choice gk the main thing is that messi strike a pose why put ronaldo in there you cunts messi is earing x more nah should try w messi next year i don t need the reminder i already knew messi was finished a long time ago lionel messi chronicles ad whodoyoucollect see playmaker oh never compare this cr bum to messi again ronaldo after messi puts past sum random saudi arabian goalie and breaks his international goal tally yoo who gba hellz yanks a kid like that men well i guess not men messi class gave him a day he ll remember ever ya tha kid was an assassin sent by cr camp cmon in the messi and ronaldo era it would ve been impossible to win it with our current attack it s like arguing messi or ronaldo canal pop let your dad achieve what messi had achieved then you won t copy and paste this shit here that s bullshit pal you think ronaldo is going around telling journalist he wants to leave so messi doesn t catch him you guys are obsessed with him messi wouldn t even score goals in ucl even if psg go all the way w messi then u implied your own mums fat i like bbws im happy with that your momma calls me messi cos i dribble inbetween her legs time and time again we miss the thursday greggs salmon got a morris so i bummed his dad if you follow in his footsteps il give you the worst beating you ever had does messi or ronaldo know you exist leo messi s goal against real madrid is the most underrated he s not replying anymore i guess he s contacting ronaldo s sister for more photos of messi let s say hypothetically having messi generates extra m or m revenue will u give him m a week for it these rm assholes are really comparing a one season wonder from vini jr to more than years of greatness and success from messi that argentine really made them suffer messi is finished just like your dream fool you are wrong no one looks so good wearing number an messi only cr fans and messi haters don t regard it obviously because your idol can t win it same as you guys disregard u world cup and the olympics because cr can never win it but who cares about you when serious football analysts and agencies count these trophies cry more general question why doesn t nobody want him he did better than messi last season and he was in team of the player and he had more awards than messi united didt win game without him i mean they can dream they are messi fans u could care about him if he wins it or not you ve tweeted your messi out about times your opinion isn t valid g who do you know the goat is again this just seem effortless messi have lost more finals than vini for those who said messi is finished he is here to stay and here to rule justgettingstarted this biased attitude towards spanish players will one day cause barcelona issues i am beyond convinced that had messi been a spaniard la liga and the club would have found a way to keep him de jong memphis imagine letting go of dani just to sign azpi for m or so haew is messi a joke to you we have a moral debt to messi we ll see what happens laporta now i m convinced there was a plot to rid of messi without an uproar from the fans i m not mad about it imagine a messi stan ruining a comment thread on twitter messi used growth hormone and stayed short maradona used cocaine so they should be disqualified i m davido and messi fan ballon d or for messi how on earth can you call messi a bad player it s just not true stop trolling messi on twitter bro he is not here not necessarily not all captain are talkers some lead by doing the business on the pitch messi messi lol that trophy worthless now after what they did to lewy she is not going to jail every rich person in spain gets in trouble for tax fraud and never goes to jail even fucking messi lol the guy interviewing is a moron going with the messi fan narrative that he s the problem putting uniteds atrocious defense last year and midfield who couldn t put passes together on ronaldo of course they are losing revenues worth m in years just to have in cash now announce messi you have done well up messi every single assumption you have made about me is incorrect and to actually think messi is washed shows your lack of football knowledge

what did messi do argentina s training jersey for the world cup thats why they want messi back in messi in international and europe finals has better goal ratio qnd g a ratio than ronaldo and neymar messi won a ballandor more recently ronaldo hasn t won a title in years u tell me who fell off the club won it s recent silverware because of messi the club is broke because of messi like drinking withouta hangover sunday the king plays goals for pendu while messi scores and wins a cup its funny since without messi they could have still won messi in psg has never been important compared to his time in barcelona cr ou messi i can t stop my guy messi from crying its all he does lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time remember when this guy was the next messi before gavi hype will sell anything to anyone didn t mention anything about the prem i am going of a individual who i d want in my team i could choose either and id rather ronaldo possess a lot more than messi your dembele hate obsession is unreal should ve prayed for a messi wc it s weird it s just a pretty girl lmao why take a picture instead of messi so font wasn t messi s guy three world cup cycles thirteen football seasons thirteen champions league finals through a messi ronaldo ballon d or rivalry and at least three nigerian presidents messi with spanish super cup goals una i m afraid that s impossible talking about messi in such light only indicates one thing she knows nothing about goals so she can t assist herself we d milking the messi revenue stream until we were broke and without titles lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time name erling haaland body zlatan hairstyle andy carroll hype ronaldo expectation lewandowski predicted performance messi reality lukaku with a little touch of yakubu spiced amp flavoured with a little touch of benteke having maguire s mentality that s not doing his job that s being a bully and abusing what little power he has good on messi for making the kids day week month year and turning a major wrong into a positive lionel messi barcelona back to black sped up get them r was a better dribbler than messi but in terms of being the best footballer it s cr who s the best player ever true maybe like a lower serie a team or bundesliga guaranteed starting time in belgium or the netherlands maybe options come to think about it mbappe is more like ronaldo than messi his incredible in front of goal he has a great pace but he s not exactly the ultimate dribbler like messi they never make one like this for ronaldo bcs messi never proclaim himself as a king on social media u can see the different blud jay jay did it sometimes neymar did a lot before messi got to psg ronaldo used to do it saint max does it so this is your goat messi clear talking about last season or the season before because messi was very much interested in last season before he was kicked out we have a lot of former players who are doing great remember messi ronaldo and all other top players are not making money in their home countries hardwork and not politics will make u rich messi intervenes after security manhandles young selfie seeker video rt sport news same question i ask with you and edgy messi slander tweets because messi seems like a nice guy ronaldo seems like an arrogant prick messi a st who constantly shifts to cam and rw in a single match goal trophy the king against rayo subed not hating just saying man u fans doesn t know ball not a single player that has watched pele and messi said that messi is the best ever that must say something you can t say messi isn t the best because he didn t do it in the pl because look at the players like r maradona legends of the game didn t play there so does that make them not that good then make one more joke about my sister i ll remove what makes you a mister lionel messi i ll tie you in knots looking like you ve just played twister always think about you mum eyes on the prize keep her happy in the bed of course it s king size all of them are also secretly men and all football legends like ronaldo or messi are female welcome to the freak show where nothing is real la liga during the ronaldo vs messi era gt gt gt gt ronaldo and messi trying their best to outperform each other every weekend amen a messi life go just dey sweet we messi fans lol his fans think his better than messi when he doesn t even pass the r and ronaldinho test for me he genuinely doesn t crack top of all time he is so fraudulent did you see how foolish you re you just see anything online and you will just decided to post it without confirming if what you re posting is true or not did you no that rating of ronaldo you posted was editing by messi fan baby hugo ekitike with lionel messi s ballons d or this season he will be playing alongside him him maloney gt messi and it s not even close have u just said messi has played against top prem teams more than ronaldo are u dumb you re the real goat forget messi and ronaldo blame messi so u support man utd but messi is my goat messi up top or callum wilson and david mcgoldrick up top hmmmmmmm tough one lmao ronaldo himself said the goat plays sunday referring to messi playing the trophee des champions final and winning it messi when he tastes the post game nigerian jollof messi is a strong player do you think hes weak haha i could guarantee you theres not a woman player out there that would shrug him off the ball can t call someone with dribble completion always in control bro only messi surely he s not going for messi if you watch what messi is doing playing on the wing deep as a midfielder cam you realize it s not comparable but you re right about the psg thing they re not gonna let him go because of the brand value etc and messi will have to take a massive pay cut to come to barca if madrid and barca for whatsoever reasons let ronaldo and messi go nobody should rate a tweet like this messi is in a commercial and when it came on my sister went ryan reynolds anyways sister for sale dm me for negotiations lool i swear yall mocked messi for playing poor in the copa america final despite him carrying argentina all the way through keep the same energy with ronaldo delusional yeah the greatest ever then like maradona was in his time since maradona it s messi closely followed by cristiano everyone else on list is great but not up to to pele maradona messi cr level that s for sure messi better yeah i forgot to mention the brazilian one cracking r messi is the best ballon d ors trophies the real reason laporta is talking about messi is because barca need footfall to get revenues up for the last years barca s revenues haven t been linked to performance although a cl win does bring in a good chunk of cash i m slowly changing my mind on ronaldo messi is turning into my goat qpr goat messi ronaldo and before someone comes and attacks me for being a penaldog or whatever the fuck i respect messi but it doesn t mean i can t make jokes about him last season dem want kill messi with criticism media go drag anybody u see this same messi make he no play well dem go still drag am the way he looks from the back and the way he runs reminds me so much of messi think you mean just messi fans new messi is here messi don t always get a proper assist and y all would be nutting lmao yes despite neymar having goals and assist messi s today s motm is as deserving as l e w a n d o w s k i his ballon d or in honestly i actually support manchester city in the premier league phil foden is damn good but mbappe is world class it s just like comparing salah to messi and i actually watch mbappe play same think some people expect haaland to be like prime messi this season when i think he ll underperform don t think it ll be peps last season though shooting is messi and u cant compare heading to a guy thats anyone has messi copa del rey pictures in k baby hugo ekitike with lionel messi s ballons d or this season he will be playing alongside him him but but but messi woulda done things differently only the fanboys of this guy woulda claim a guy with has no intelligence what a degenerate fanbase i ve never said they should play together are you seriously suggesting there aren t women in the world stronger than messi the espn own is cool atleast in thier own writing but this is not cool yes u can hate on someone but atleast set boundaries disrespecting them should be no no screen shooting someone s message to reply messi is so embarrassing u guys shud accept it that is bad simple how are you sucking ronaldo and messi off at the same time that s why the idols has security to check everything they can check the boy from head to feet then let him close to messi messi should stop and wait to see the security signal it is easy you have messi and felix in your bio ronaldo literally no help messi plays with incredible players and in a farmers league stop living in the past xavi iniesta and messi came in the early s messi s rabbit stew bar messi antonella thank you mis pasiones messi hq taylor boca y spiderman lionel messi s feelings on barcelona return revealed read here the funny thing is messi is one of the strongest players out there messi antonella thank you i don t think we ll see a dribbler like hazard ever again that sort of balance agility willingness to drop deep and beat people is something only messi and neymar can do im talking about pele now tell me has messi ever won a world cup barca have done this to reinforce the team because they have let go off some of the highest earners at the club doesn t matter if they wanted to keep them or not likes of suarez vidal rakitic semedo messi griezmann coutinho arthur and even renegotiated some contracts my guy had acres of space to turn and progress the ball but chose to back pass it until the opposition could press i m clueless how tf did this guy ever get compared to messi messi antonella thank you europa league

think men and women should play together you need your brains tested literally when suarez was in his prime scoring more goals than ronaldo and messi benzema couldnt even score goals playing in probably the best real madrid of all time so shut up benzema is great but lucky than messi and cr are not the same rn sualee and messi weirdest take ever if you genuinely watch ronaldo and messi play

history to write your own messi was doing km a game those kind of numbers have never been seen before he s not clear of him pal pele is great obviously and one of best ever but football wasnt as competitive and it was easier to win a world cup back then he also played for the best team club careers messi gt pele definitely look at the numbers and longevity honours i don t really think anyone can match messi or ronaldo but after these to hang their boots mbappe is likely to be the face of football be real we re talking about someone who messi s shadow couldn t cover even naymer couldn t do

again in to get spanked by messi again and real madrid just won another ucl without rapenaldo respect isn t given it s earned the day ronaldo starts performing like messi is the day he ll get his respect till then he can stick to his family and fanpages hyping him up on social media making a mockery of himself and then playing the victim card is his trademark make sure you are following this account for all the latest news on messi messi and neymar downed tools to get poch sacked it wouldn t have worked out anyways i m only into women with severe mental issues can you cop me a psg ticket

have both been booked every time they ve done it too messi better ronaldo doesn t want to fulfill his united contract messi in held that idiotic tv interview complaining that bartomeu wouldn t let him leave to city in a month that wasn t june messi and ronaldo i think messi is the goat but cut from the same cloth selfishness riqui puig when fans in la start comparing him to messi for making a simple switch of play the fact is messi is the greatest player of all time debate was over in but ronaldos pr is keeping him in the conversation and messi was still the best on the team so your point if no be winch barca dey go sell part of their tv right just to compete na we tell dem make dem use all their life and future savings dey pay messi salary ni witchcraft or ment bringing in messi or

messi the media are messi s fan lol so messi had better teamtes than ronaldo nice talk that young forward was greenwood dat is just d reality today cr score goals u finish wthout a trophy or ucl counts as nothing messi fans came up with the narrative that he does more than scoring he is now a full fledge playmaker amp his playmaking stats support him iranian bloke looks more like messi in fact identical messi played badly last year because he lost in the offseason he arranged for a referendum to have font installed and renew at his full salary and drive the club into oblivion but laporta beat him destroyed his confidence for the whole year should be better this year will messi end up in debt fc i d really like to have an example of something putin s done wrong it seems to me the guy is like the messi of the politicians of the world first of all you deserve a punch for saying something like that you clown and second he s right he s not saying salah is better than messi cause he s not but he would make bits of la liga having better team players helps you have more trophies and can make your stats better imagine the difference between messi assisting you and a revolution in montevideo luis su rez arrived on messi s plane and a crowd accompanied him for his presentation at nacional messi is the goat how was it for you when messi became official to psg what were you thinking psg messi without injury r without a doubt was a world class striker despite biscuit knees imagine an injury free career we d be talking about someone greater than messi messi s sleeve does not lie messi skills and goals reaction via this is what i call entertainment it s not just goals it s goals with flair these kids just run fast and we call them the next messi instead of calling them the next bolt not many can play in small pocket i like messi but saying this is pretty hypocritical since it s been reported that at years of age messi dated a year old girl a player with bdo shouldn t be compared to a player with the most in history messi has more bdo than the entire utd team combined and ermm more cls too the fact that messi has less games yet more non penalty club goals goals than ronaldo isn t talked about enough of course you re not going to comment on the past fans have short memories i hated psg for stealing neymar now we see a menage a trois between messi ney and messi on a psg bedspread and it s all ok there is no difference between messi and ronaldo amp respect to club loyalty carl s jr gt gt mc donald s messi gt gt cr xbox gt gt ps blame messi for scoring and winning another trophy i ve tried but this place just not the same no face no messi no rick no raptor mangle dicks used as an ashtray no degan thread takeovers your actually trying to put woman players in the same sentence as messi haha woman arent strong enough for the mens game simple as that could you imagine a woman taking a tackle from van dijk it would be a leg breaker there no where near as quick as men either what the fuck you yapping about how many assists did messi give mbappe last season that kid is better than both of em combined at the moment take this and know peace mate psg galtier reveals one major similarity between messi neymar messi son neymar insigne don t give these men space for r i just hope they don t ruin him he has potential to be special milanisti tracking cdk s flight and hyping him up like we signed prime messi what s the point saying he got better teammates if ronaldo is better according to you like i said just excuses to not accept that messi is better then ronaldo messi got subbed after mins too bottle what mate individually messi is the best player to ever live and nobody stands close lionel messi lent ex barcelona teammate luis suarez his m private jet ahead of emotional nacional return like for messi how people managed to sneak this guy into the goat conversation will forever remain a mystery to me this guy isn t as intelligent as messi and maradona neither is he more talented nor does he possess better abilities than them yet some people say he s better than them lol fastest women m is seconds there are plenty of women fast enough lionel messi the best player ever is ft hes neither the fastest strongest or anywhere near tallest player your points are all invalid also as an extra if we use this logic for messi vs ronaldo speed ronaldo passing messi shooting ronaldo heading ronaldo dribbling messi goals debatable but messi clear imo assists messi messi wins without even adding playmaking aspects and chance creation too lmfao robbed ballon d or didn t do shit in ligue was carried to a league title that psg win every year another cup that psg win every year stop it bro messi sucks i m not gonna comment on past club also had power if messi was charging that they should have taken a stance a lot earlier bt these are past no way he s coming back i was talking about this didn t this guy lose a header to messi in a ucl final know who s job it was to press xavi before the pass take a wild guess it s your loser idol bro i need that messi signature for dollars at the barca shop yo ur crazy barca was so cheat vs madrid without suarez and messi so how people managed to sneak this guy into the goat conversation will forever remain a mystery to me this guy isn t as intelligent as messi and maradona neither is he more talented nor does he possess better abilities than them yet some people say he s better than them lol la liga rules says other wise we all love messi and for our club to continue to have a big name or scaring we need to have good players and pray they all succeed and give them maximum supports they needs we re treating him like messi ffs with bahia ok lets count messi trophies with barca b amp old boys too what are those trophies anyway if its not the league the cup the regional league then it must be bullshit trophies saw a footage of messi being angry at him tho neymar addresses mbappe conflict and praises difference maker messi hypothetical theories did bartomeu and messi have a bad relationship which one of them had the responsibility for looking after the club which one was looking after his personal interest money fame power messi wasn t interested in barca any more than cr in united messi first got his big game player shouts when he scored a debut hattrick in an away clasico he got the shouts again when he destroyed man utd amp ronnie in the ucl final he then got more such shouts when he destroyed real madrid amp ronnie in the ucl semis so no bullshit pls this is so embarrassing how are u screaming at your tv like you ve just seen messi score in a ucl final after messi leo and his insert nationality messi the said messi always disappears in finals my grandfather would tell me about di stefano my dad talks about maradona i m gonna tell my kids about messi the goats of their time i m truly privileged to witness the greatest player of his time i ll talk about him until i tell pass on yup without if he didn t bottle this competition messi would probably have a better argument for being the so either loan or rot there that s facts literally for that one messi game against nantes i ve seen so many different comps on twitter and youtube would be hard to even gain a following there messi first got his big game player shouts when he scored a debut hattrick in el clasico he got the shouts again when he destroyed man utd amp ronaldo in the ucl final he then got more such shouts when he destroyed real madrid amp ronnie in the ucl semis so no bullshit pls neymar had two goals plus an assist yet somehow messi got the motm award robbing in daylight i like messi but this pr has got to stop i m gonna be so happy when fab s comments

hugging messi and neymar with the same jersey on is still so wild to me he goes for liverpool is from belgium and a messi fan we can t take him seriously messi just on his second will turn fly a pass

turnaround by xavi wasn t world class btw koeman was losing to cadiz with messi in xavi we trust ever thought it s not an agenda that the whole world know messi is the goat face facts ronaldo is in

ron and also more assists simple football players with most trophies in history dani alves leo messi andres iniesta maxwell ryan giggs hapsport hap sport they were like messi neymar and suarez in this guy will always be a villain in messi s story once again the worst of the worst an account pretending to be a fan of messi ronaldo in order to slander them has an iq of many reasons why laporta said we should bring back messi an obvious one is that fans are starting to wonder did laporta intentionally rig the books to kick messi out answer yes but the other reason is he likely knows that messi is renewing at psg no way he s coming back give me the drugs messi i don t even support messi lol plus i don t hate ronaldo just want you to accept that no clubs want him i m a man united fan though just like messi ruined barca messi is the goat messi finals goals definitely a terrible take anyone who disagrees is just a mumu messi is the main reason your man get less trophies and less final goals nigga has been dunking on ronaldo in finals they ve met champions league final copa del rey finals spanish super cup finals and many more is that why you put on bvb jersey on him messi have really disappoint all his haters not with frenkie as if frenkie is smarter than cou grizu or messi they all left the club amp we owe them those wages amp they ll get paid so quit with they shitty wages excuses amp just admit that he doesn t want to become pogba this will end up playing the exact same way a or would danilo dropping to a cb spot halimi and nuno pushing high messi dropping deep to collect the ball messi fans we have to start pushing messi agenda for an ballon dor award this year greatest player of this generation after ronaldo messi ney scored from spot kicks the only thing counted was his assists messi created lots of chances apart from his goals is like y all don t know what motm means will say messi has to do it in epl messi is an incredible player but psg always carry all those french trophies na bad guy know watin i day talk my guy messi bad e just day psg day collect free trophies we know the scope lionel messi won another trophy yesterday why are you all quite the thought of a sulking ronaldo on the bench every time messi scores a goal in the champions league is not what i envisioned when the season ended should ve been messi without pr ronaldo wouldn t even be in the goat debate in terms of actual performances i see no difference between benzema lewandowski suarez and ronaldo messi is a tier above ronaldo played career games more than messibut messi needs only goals also played club games more than messi but messi needs just goals to equal better than gavi but not on par with messi leo messi surpassed pele s number and became the most player in history to score in final matches with clubs goals in finals recording percentage in the finals is for this miraculous you can say the same thing when messi stayed at barca while cr was in juve didn t know you did messi slander lionel messi net worth age height and more paris saint germain nantes neymar scores brace with lionel messi and sergio ramos also on target in trophee des champions messi opened the scoring before neymar added ramos scored neymar then rounded off the scoring from the penalty spot late on messi owns our idolo what a shame goal involvements in matches is not bad for a finished messi though i can t say of cr but lionel messi in his prime can never score with cucurella in a defense chelsea about to do the treble but every couple of year there s a new xavi iniesta and messi coming from your academy only to end up at turkish league messi is finished honestly this guy has been tweeting about messi since i feel ur pain bro many more tears for u shed

called favourite stat you have no point there and the thing here is you have to learn to admit that messi is a complete player and he do ran games cry i d be fine giving the kid a shot in cup matches and other non important ones but i understand wanting a veteran there too what does ronaldinho have to do with pele winning a world cup just answer were was messi at that age the german messi it wasn t even related to messi people been on his ass since he said it lol bunch of weirdos messi got more ballon d ors than vinicius jr has goals in finals you re sucking messi s ass and hating on ronaldo for no reason stick to believing fake reports like prime messi hype him up fair enough but don t take the piss and compare him to the greatest player your ever going to watch play the game i m not triggered by it i m explaining why messi got so much coverage for winning that motm which you seem triggered by a president of barca amp his board are elected to preserve the club and advance its agenda the idea that a president intentionally destroyed the club is ridiculous bartomeu simply couldn t handle messi tusquets said we should get rid of messi laporta got rid of messi simple as that messi is clear mfs when ronaldo replies that he is a king on a post that calls him king vs mfs when messi replies to himself with clapping emojis on his own post you have seen the light for those who say that prime pr is comparable to prime messi in any way watch the games with your eyes favorite athlete is messi instant fan apart from christiano rolando messi and ronaldinho i won t stop any footballer for a selfie shameless media i m long time follower of i know that they are messi s pr team but i was following them but after this they have totally declared themselves that it s only a messi fan page just fuck off the croatian messi the japanese messi the turkish messi the french messi messi ain t even a football player he a smash bros chararacter with different skins lionel messi sur rs pinterest messi and suarez are not players don t bother arguing with this dude you re wasting your breath by his logic if you signed prime messi and another team signed ashley barnes and ashley barnes scored first it d make ashley barnes better this one say brazilian akpororo play pass messi wetin person no go see for football streets i m out here putting up messi like numbers for the brand and i get no recognition shakira needs messi s lawyer barcelona before messi champions in years barcelona with messi champions in years go to bed stop posting messi prop i follow you for barca content paris saint germain nantes neymar scores brace with lionel messi and sergio ramos also on target in trophee des champions messi opened the scoring before neymar added a second ramos score neymar then rounded off the scoring from the penalty spot late on messi is the goat but this goal is nothing special the real ronaldo done this about times what kind of braindead statement is that so messi shouldn t expect to play with neymar and mbappe then or modric shouldn t expect to play with benzema and casemiro because hes you just know messi is the goat when players like xavi who played with him for over years are astonished by the goals he produces fans start celebrating before the ball goes in the net legends of the game are dumbfounded well said like if messi didn t practice or get the courage to press he d become the great player he is today even ronaldo said it that to become great you need to take chances and be selfish sometimes fergie was cooking him with park ji sung and rafael messi the only reason pep has ever touched ucl in his life ik you don t believe he s on the same level as prime messi no xd it s hardest role in league it s like you ask messi teach me ronaldo hasn t been good to watch for years since he got the knee issue and had to move to a centre forward messi s game has dropped deeper and still has an outrageous output what excuses messi is now playing with a great team messi in last years barcelon played with world class strikers like luis suarez and antonies grezman world class midfielders rikitic iniestia if you love wizkid messi and ass pls follow me we re family i follow back spawn makes everyone ragequit new video is up flygodgang mkmobile spawn mortalkombat mortalkombat youtube fightinggames xboxseriesx entertainment hobipalooza theflash disneyplus fifa yankees onepiece playstation padres messi messi is the goat talkyourtalk messi cristiano ronaldo scored goals against arsenal goals against tottenham and goal against chelsea last season that s goals in just games messi only scored ligue goals last season who would it be bettinelli messi had key passes with no bcc big chanceshe created while ney had key passes with bcc messi owns my idol i can t remember the last time messi scored in a ucl final vini gt messi for me the instagram post called ronaldo king and he simply replied to it calling himself king any words on your favorite player having kingjames as his instagram handle messi fans live in a delusional hypocritical world of their own let him goooooooo the man wants ucl he s got to score more goals than messi playing in the mls before busquets messi and suarez urgent mercato news l o messi will join paris saint germain today for more than you can even imagine they flopped so it s stupid to say messi always had good teammates ronaldo had the greatest madrid team ever and man utd team so stop with those weak excuses why he would do that best pure talent since messi and after him bojan ever to appear in barca seems talent is only a small part of success galtier must continue to play a at psg for the rest of the season that shape allows hakimi and mendes to provide width and penetration from wing back and it also allows messi mbapp and neymar to be in close proximity between the lines and to counter press effectively that s literally possible if they go on a trip for pre season of course messi has nothing against jews why would he refuse to visit that monument even non jews visit it thank you so much he got some skills i guess sure messi regen u tripping hmmn hope you re not including ronaldo messi and wizkid fans to this agenda dude this guy is kinda jumping onto bandwagons first he was with madrid then he supported barca first ronaldo fan now messi future i don t know maybe he will say he s a manchester fan and support the blues because his club is downhill since years reply doesn t change the fact that this is a farmers league since psg finished every time except times they would have won the league even without messi this year do you really think messi made them champions this year my book is better than messi s books same i think it s the teams we dislike rather than players except penaldo like psg i still dislike even with messi forgot messi ronaldo is the goat cuz of long shots messi is cuz of being greatest dribbler greatest playmaker and goalscoring messi owns my idol ansu fati the black messi galtier did not fail to credit pochettino not a mistake to like this guy i like him ever since he shut down messi neymar and mbappe last season what is a psg messi fan doing under a bar a related tweet trying to act like he knows what happened cause even the media knows messi is the goat more engrossed in ellis messi gate than love island trophies for messi when he plays for the best club in the country and also who said ronaldo is a beast this season and lets not forget you are also counting friendlies exclusive interview with president bar a s transfer window finances player registrations the de jong situation club s moral debt with messi more full interview the man already shut down messi s goat debate let me mansplain it for you since you re not getting it in football players in both teams are women in men s football men play against men whining that eng men can t win cos they have to play against messi etc simply begs the question why this is like comparing messi with my nan neymar messi mbapp verratti hakimi and his point still stands you cant compare messi playing with probably the best team in football in terms of player quality in a farmers league where one team dominates it to the manchester united team ronaldo played with in the hardest league in the world steady prime messi is far far far from everyone messi and westbrook have had similar impact on their teams record breaking wages with low outputs and preventing their teams from improving the squads don t get me wrong i love cristiano but messi is just better it s the truth so you expect pep to move to bloody burnley or something after he s just won a sextuple at barca that s like asking messi to move to west ham pel messi in finals games goals assists team goals goal contribution finals won finals pel is clearly the most decisive player in history i admire mbappe a lot but thinking he s some wonder kid that nobody can reach his level is beyond my understanding i know for a fact half of people speaking haven t see him play a full season just see his stats on twitter and hype on bt and fifa think he s some next messi a im love football ronaldo top and messi top onflow hope ea gives donnarumma a proper scan along with benzema amp messi messi is not catching up g he s washed messi s moving message to suarez bet now via hahahahahah better left foot than messi you guys said all of madridstas want him out now how is stating a fact making fun of messi ironic opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he said on social media days in the past ronaldo is finished g o a t lionel andres messi no barca or messi fans want to watch a finished year old play has to be messi fam polo says he s better than messi so guess just change your name to messi fc nonsense look at ucl messi has the most goals for barca and the one who has the most isn t even player it s own goals also neymar is like dr with goals he left in shows he was carrying them alone pep had his best years with messi bodies of four slain policemen recovered in bayelsa boat mishap nigerian news bayelsa boatmishap bbnaija messi wizkid davido actually baffles me how people can think messi isn t the better player enjoy messi s defending against players more than his size the difference is pep that s why lol even messi had his best years under pep that s how it is with both messi and ronaldo their fans make it unbearable messi less bullshit more business so this really a question we gonna compare the goat with r now and ask who you taking you clearly won t post this about messi would you outscoring messi and winning champions leagues everytime pessi starts trending its because messi won something and irrational twitter users are upset because of that they are literally messi stans themselves lionel messi scored goals in it was cristiano ronaldo who had more shots than messi in the same year while scoring goals less cr shot and inshallah i promise you of ppl try and enjoy how good messi is only to open up social media to see shit like this people who ve never seen cdk play a minute of football already claiming he s the next messi if you remove all messi s goal contributions argentina was gonna win nothing and that s trophies yea i remember that xavi chance reverse pass from messi for xavi on his right foot if if if without if s messi wins the goat debate and thats it there is no messi vs anyone its messi the greatest and only knockouts goals in competitions wont change anything about it funn thing is that ronaldo have even played games more than messi and also played more than games that muller suarez and di maria you are such a shameless fuckhead no wonder you kept coming back for more malik na goat he don dey level with ronaldo and messi exactly vamos messi who is your goat like for ronaldo retweet for messi cristianoronaldo cr mufc messi m psg i hope sinner can continue playing at this level alongside alcaraz and keep pushing each other not just for the fun rivalry but players make each other better look at messi ronaldo and the big three they wouldn t have become the players they were without that competition jackson messi funny how tapinaldo fans gather here to say messi is a tap in merchant whereas tapinaldo has tap in goals lol you are a shameless fool ronaldo had more assists than messi messi overtook him he had more assists than muller muller overtook him he had more assists than suarez suarez overtook now di maria needs only assists to equal him and overtake him i m tired of this lie at no point did anambra overtake lagos in hdi that it had a higher percentage in hdi development from previous year s doesn t change that that you had a salary increase while messi had a salary increase doesn t make you earn more than messi prime messi and alves was crayyt get of messi dick barca finished without messi you have a better chance at signing messi shaolin soccer gt gt gt football messi would not have won those ballon d or if he was in this league why do you think the idiots had to let go of messi they overpaid everyone and he scored all the goals and you try saying he disappeared i can t say the same for messi in fifa i signed him at barcelona and he bagged more than messi and suarez remove every single messi stat and you will see ronaldo at the top i m not taking away from messi s greatness at all i m just stating facts for you to be the most complete ever you ve to be great off the ball davide supports messi opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he said on

asked if i wanted more i said i m lionel messi then she knew i was finished typical messi fans even though if you re a messi fan saying messi is the most complete ever is just dumb im not denying his greatness but how can you be the most complete when being a bad defensively the most complete ever is players like yaya toure ads gerrard players who could do everything psg will not let him leave they will make him an offer he can t refuse psg is making hundreds of mullions due to him that s the only reason laporta wants him barca has new players that are the future messi will not be a token ceremonial player move on messi has it s too late messi has trophies in the last months of them from the farmers league where he was motm in the final but yeah okay hows ronaldo doing can t remember the last trophy he saw has he got a club yet lmao cool now announce messi i m on my knees football don t have god only goat we have in football and that s one leo messi is the g o a t while others ronaldo and co are good and no club want ronaldo any more he is not good enough and catastrophe over hype player by english media did messi really join psg or he was kicked by laliga messi earns more

hate messi honestly every other couple is shite compared to davide and ekin this year but them two are messi and ronaldo together most of messi ballondor are stolen ones so it probably isn t the best comparison pep and messi will always be underestimated because of how good they are opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he stated on social media days previously opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he stated on social media days previously for the amount of attention it s getting i d expect messi s as for it s come home they ve never won anything so how could it be home is that supposed to be messi looks more like jordi alba for me opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he said on social media days in the past tassco the talks today messi played with a dead barca team for like years carrying them all the time and then messi yena why s he so happy we won t even mention messi in a big game conversation but of course he s welcome in the eibar mix messi ronaldo neymar hazard zlatan cavani modric kroos ramos suarez marcelo iniesta a great era of players slowly coming to an end i heard names like fucking pedri this guy is an absolute scrub people saying give him time as if messi has any time get rid of this nonsense man puig is ready and would instantly add more pedri has let bar a down in big game after big game shame this why messi is the greatest card player of all time this was my favorite version of cr he wore his heart on his sleeve that season despite messi winning the balland or x consecutively cr ill believed himself to be the best he was on the cover of pes scored la liga goals and in all competitions bloody bayen ucl pen messi and you in one picture what do i wish more than that i love you two wasn t he the messi successor and now how choosen to retire at the age of football bloodhell still messi teamates gt ronaldo s teamates download nollywood movie love in the dark nollywood movie nollywoodmovie video movie loveinthedark downloadpage bbnaija messi wizkid davido in honor of messi approaching the biggest sum of his career goals at the top level we decided to post every single one from his first to his latest one is that why every manager ever has reconfirmed how messi is unearthly and ronaldo is nowhere near him last night i went to a restaurant in paris after i ate my food the waitress asked if i wanted more i said i m lionel messi then she knew i was finished spotting something sus already in this comp a bcc for villa by messi yet not counted in the game stats on that was then messi is gone now messi the best this award is one messi can t rob this ain t no pr award or popularity contest opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he said on social media days in the past techbondhu tinubu s muslim muslim ticket a sign of war prophet iginla warns news iginla muslim muslimticket tinubu bbnaija messi wizkid davido useless without goals he s highest assister in history and most ucl show messi tracking back and defending like this you be messi fan messi the only answer i thought beyonce and messi fans were the worst i was wrong stfu he was outstanding yesterday at a cup final ronaldo is no where near messi in overall football play rivaldo left we moved on ronaldinho left probably the most painful but we moved on let messi leave and old wounds heal literally don t know how anyone thinks he is anywhere near messi nhar li jebtou messi why messi is better better goal record than ronaldo better assist record than ronaldo more team in less seasons more individual in less seasons more balon dors in less seasons more golden boots in less seasons now explain to me how ronaldos better the world won t stop the messi ronaldo debate we ve signed of those amp won t sign the other you d be as well writing that we ve signed messi if your going to get it wrong be as well doing it properly idiot pendu pimps king is back ya surely messi was the king who was back on sunday who had scored a goal and won a trophy mean while ronaldo left the match before half time he never listens to anyone and always goes for his individual glory all the time the ghost of manu the worst teammates are always the worst excuses from you ronaldo fans messi s positioning has nothing to do with teammates also ronaldo had the best madrid squad ever and one of the best utd squad ever and i will look for a ronaldo heatmap but don t expect to see him in midfield nobody said that real fans dont just replace people and call em the next ronaldo not like barca fans calling every guy who played as an attacker in la masia the next messi funny no hilarious yes amp true messi good in league with only decent teams ronaldo bossed it in every league he s played in that s why ronaldo is the goat amp more than a league player dude you gave up on defending ronaldo and now you re going after messi dude signed for psg days after he left barca what rejection are you talking about no one hates messi they hate his fans opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he said on social media days in the past come here when you win a trophy without messi then i will be in pain if he meant to be messi looks nothing like him lol funny thing is messi never scored international finals goal in finals and copa del rey finals vs rma ronaldo with all those skills just dribble pass player and dive while messi uses one skill dribble pass multiply and score opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he said on social media days in the past aint no way ding dong deserves it and pedri isn t a hell even he didn t want it he wanted nobody in the team is messi and nobody will ansu is now move tf on didn t even mention the messi of reality tv stephen bear you could bring ronaldo messi neymar mbappe kdb lewa kroos modric whoever the fuck u want and juve will still not suceed because of allegris antifootball tactics hes had year to bring something up yet we stil lack ideas when attacking allegri must go and they are absolutely right tbf cristiano plays for himself to show his body messi is a team man plays for his team great logic that mate haven t watched games of messi is he even good like has to be that pic with messi messi planned this imo you think everyone not supporting cr is a messi fan i m a man united fan not player fan barca messed up by letting messi go the way they did you know what happened when messi faced rma in copa del rey finals hes busy scoring vs alaves and bilbao tho hey messi he said am i a bad person i tried i i couldn t answer i watched as the light went out of his eyes and i couldn t give him his final answer i hate barca with a passion but you can not argue the fact that lionel andres messi is the goat unless frankie de jong is another messi too expensive in my opinion if united didn t finish top e price tag will be the headline lol buying xmon means ur gonna have to avoid getting dumped on by messi sisyphus and magellen some of the most notorious dumping bandits praying for holders rn opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he said on social media days in the past tassco opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he said on social media days in the past tassco opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he said on social media days in the past tassco dam brother is so depressed he needs notifications for ronaldo to put messi when no ones fucking talking about him opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he said on social media days in the past tassco messi doesn t speak much but his pr is insane maybe that s the privilege of been the better footballer you found the one site that had messi as the best player well done do you want to go tit for tat on screenshots of match ratings from sites to see who wins besides i thought the buck stopped at motm isnt that messi fans favourite stat iniesta won momt and you still arguing opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he said on social media days in the past opinion messi is the true king of football not cr as he said on social media days in the past toxic top reds than fancy messi omg lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time if cr would ve started his career at madrid like messi did with barca it d be a different story we saw what happens when ronaldo came to la liga and we se what messi did without barca messi must be involved in this dick riding messi everyone in the league despite missing the first games rooney just wasn t on that level cr messi weren t the no in their teams yet they score loads same as salah rooney was a second striker and couldn t crack the golden boot lmaooo messi would have missed the drone target the welsh messi is in the mls nah if i have a friend still arguing ronaldo vs messi at this point in life i know he is not ready to progress i want to renew but now that we have messi i can t just putting it out to universe and they said he s better than messi are you messi fan acting like every club didnt reject him last summer pls tell me how many goals messi has from yards out i am no fan of the snp and nicola sturgeon but to compare her with truss in football terms it s comparing lionel messi to lionel blair sturgeon perhaps unfortunately is a brilliant politician truss looks like a startled chicken and has the politics of a stuffed one the goat is messi right so you are trying to make him like goat but no big club want or ask for him even atletico madrid fans didn t want him he ll play europa league and he ll lose you are back back messi kind of thing winning almost everything winnable my arsenal very own mead beth congratulations queen bar a news round up as kounde is officially presented welcome our left back situation discussed including the debate surrounding alejandro balde and yet more reports linking messi with a return to bar a in its like u ask messi teach me this young fan was being taken away by security but messi stopped them so the boy take a selfie with him messi has won major trophies since the start of wc next great statement not every great in all sports can say they fullfil this statement magic bird messi lebron zidane are good examples hello hasen where can i find please the interview you did with messi thinking about messi a little too much today benzema s last season ucl campaign is greater than anything messi has done just goals you must be a kid whatever that is exciting you about messi cr ticked all those boxes already football will long forget messi but ronaldo s legacy will go from generation to generation like pele and maradonna messi has done nothing other than eibar moments rm or lm still someone who plays on the wing also loot at this vid the fact messi only has like goals less in matches is insane you forgot messi bruh bro wtf gaitan was an amazing player only him and messi scored outside the box panenka free kick that is just a bit of what he has done they actually thought he might have never been able to play football ever again at his peak like messi said was one of the best he ever saw messi messi suarez gt mbappe neymar neymar msn has more success has better individual skills nothing more to compare buddy lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time messi fans when they see someone who isn t obsessed with messi messi is actually the real goat italy are frauds messi owns them the reason why atm gives you the card first is because it knows money changes people you ll end up leaving the card over there trendingtopics messi ronaldo neymar better in big games than messi how hard is it to understand that messi scores every mins amp ronaldo scores every mins he will pretend to not understand it because it completely destroys his argument people we trying to say messi fell off aswell messi should learn to play ghostbusters he s better than messi suarez and neymar combined no doubt we d sign messi and people would complain i m not nervous lindelof speaks on martinez taking his position at man united epl sport lindelof martinez bbnaija messi wizkid davido i always thought thierry henry chose messi because he played w him but i just took in he is just anti ronaldo because the greatest player to ever play in the pl debate was settled by him discrediting to an extent henry s entire career damn you stupid messi fans need to wake up and realize he s a stat padder comparing messi to cr is annoying benzema basically has a bigger ucl legacy than messi i wonder if he can break messi s record of goals in the uber eats league was you expecting messi levels i mean we all know that you are messi fc so we really do not care hard when you have arguably the two best players on the planet at the time in messi amp cristiano plus a definite top in iniesta how far back in history does one need to go to find a midfielder about as good as xavi yrs for messi maradona is yrs ago he also played less games and almost less years the only way it makes sense is to admit messi is the goat messi haric im not obsessed with ronaldo far from it i just don t like his attitude on the pitch simple as that oh and he will always be second best in my eyes to messi if messi came would he play as an interior lionel messi and c ronaldo of journalism in nigeria better than messi messi gt cr suarez gt benzema neymar gt bale only messi cr one is debatable other two pretty clear but even the first messi has more ballon d ors more golden shoes better goal ratio more assists is a better playmaker if we are being honest it is true too damn i thought he was the next messi besides cr fanpages roasting messi definitely not the media part pal we can show the media giving ronaldo lots of pr and messi none ronaldo has messi has doesn t he lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time that s what penaldo fangurls with no ball knowledge thinks the reason y messi has alot of motm they just gifting him for some dribbles finished career like messi wrong messi had threatened to leave the club in many occasions he even got a red card against athletic bilbao highlights his selfish attitude when his team needed him the most he went on and done something stupid yes add g a to make messi look good bro solely exist to deny messi world cup on does this mean that pritchard is as good in the championship as maddison is in the pl as if that s true ivan make some mad comparison s about me in my over s a side and messi the article was about poch he was the one that sold out not messi psg had no system last year and there was no teamwork they only won because they have so much talent with proper coaching they could have achieved a lot more what about messi lol put messi in that man utd team and he ll have ga madrid have won champions league without ronaldo lmao ronaldo has never carried a club to glory like messi has mario gotza the german messi and ronaldo literally has scored double the goals messi has this year messi has the easiest career of all time supported by the media sepp blatter and france football there was a time where he was next in line behind messi and ronaldo don t me best teams attract the best it is a fact benzema won his champions league because he is not playing for manchester united or psg messi won balons d or because he was not playing for arsenal you have good players out there luck favours the best too just relax and enjoy it messi is finished huh messi fans only you know how many socis barca has in catalonia itself i agree with your other points btw messi has better stats in finals mate and better player scores messi goat he had a team full of stars and dominate players in european leagues that s just an excuse messi came out and said it himself he failed at international level messi ronaldo wan follow person wey use can bend goal post drag lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time you can make a reasonable assumption that messi will score more than goal every games to catch ronaldo if they both played the same number of games not sure why you re using trophies when you said previously that team trophies don t matter in the debate i have a big bag gami is like thomas m ller there are bigger stars like messi mappe neymar etc but this guy don t like him or bayern at all won the trippe times masterchip like what times and the world cup i was hiking with my friends when we ran out of water we came across the river but we had no way of drinking water from it fortunately messi came along and did what he does best he bottled it and carried along like it was nothing always been messi uefa team of the year as a midfielder ronaldo messi a shit competition held every years that nobody cared about it till messi won he is wrong but keep blowing his dick and defend him run far away messi if this guy should be keeper who s messi and ronaldo are you not a messi fan why sadly then yeah keep believing that ronaldo never was a midfielder and messi drops deep in the midfield all the time amaechi tells angry apc supporters who to vote politics amaechi apc bbnaija messi wizkid davido espn blamed messi out of nowhere for pochettino sacking blamed messi for barca loss but with ronaldo is he doesn t have good teammates meanwhile barca teammates then was ass paid pr ruined this sport so the self proclaimed goat can fool casuals messi trying not to hurt bro s feelings firstly messi is lad and the other point is that padrian is finished messi vs city messi mayweather federer bolt are my goats can t believe that about messi a silly accusation never understood the pr argument i guess goals in one year came from messi s good pr espn plus other groups are just panels made of individuals with own opinions i don t why pple think their comments on either player is a merit or demerit to that particular player oh of course messi used to make runs too it s not the same as ansu or ferran occupying the st position the the st is at different position dennis desperate to join another club watford chief giaretta sport emmanueldennis giaretta watfordchief bbnaija messi wizkid davido ronaldo started his carreer as a midfielder had to move to different clubs and had worse comparsion that is why messi has better goal ratio than ronaldo hiding the fact messi hasn t scored up to goals man utd fan shouldn t even be allow to judge messi messi s owner more like messi isn t he he owns argentina amp messi lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time well bullocks oh fucking sir u england fckrs ronaldo just fckng sucked and messi won another trophy so eat it messi goals was in a friendly match i am ready for that convo cos there is a reason i don t follow goal br and espn acct here cos of their agenda against messi christiano has one good game and they post him abt times or more he has a bad game and they post maguire or another team mate na only messi can explain it selfie with messi happy to see everyone having fun even messi and neymar looks so much more jolly this season they all kinda looked gloomy under poch last season excited for the new season psg galtier reveals one major similarity between messi neymar having to wingers who want the ball will bake you struggle you realize neymar used to make runs when he played with messi at barca even this pre season you ll see how ansu used to swap with the striker brenden aaronson the medford messi people who are goats people who have generational talent imo in no order michael jordan for basketball messi for football juice wrld for music bruce lee for a bunch of shit see how happy barca is without messi i speak for all culers that we don t need messi back hahaha check messi assist and come back here and tell us the last time i checked messi was not a striker so please stop crying messi getting closer obviously it s not weird at all that messi and ronaldo get all the individual awards unless the other players out perform them in a way it cannot be ignored messi is still better man should delete this it makes him look like knows nothing about messi and ronaldo or el clasico hell it makes him look like he don t know football at all good evening ppl need a new messi avi can u lot reply with some why s garnacho getting cr and messi typa hype at that age he s nowhere near either at that age let the kid develop all this hype will only get to his head and end up like gabriel obertan bro if i scored goals each season or once in my life for example messi only did it once must be a fluke btw something overrated which brought him nothing in the end result not hating and quality over quantity you know why are you shooting urself in the leg i m trying to tell you that no matter hw much we pay players we can t go bankrupt man united makes at least m every year in the club and what affected barca was that they mostly had messi fans as supporters and not the club what he has not even played one full game for us ball knowledge but have fun with sarr sammy gyamfi chooses between messi and ronaldo now social media is on fire messi what a goal weuro ghana bru messi was washed this season take the l and move ney is more important to the team than mbapp also ney and messi play better without mbapp you can say this with chest somehow after messi only just won an international trophy playing against farmers while ronaldo carried us all the way to that final i didn t say this once considering that would be very stupid to say baring in mind i said messi is the best creative player which comes with being insane on the ball making plays like no other messi nightmare but you d probably protect messi all the time even though he s the most overrated player in history far from it wtf is this now we barely survived the two legs against that barcelona team in that semifinal they were the better team home and away and united were the best team in the world at the time henry eto o xavi messi could have walked into any team in the s put aside messi and ronaldo he s the best footballer ever you sold your own club to the glazers worse case scenario barcelona will be sold to a billionaire that will ruin it like the glazers gave with united messi s passing was so incredible that season i struggle to believe it isn t higher tbh but i haven t got the time or willpower to grind through the all the games i ll leave that to galtier s psg don t miss mbappe as messi neymar and ramos run riot against nantes marca psg parissaintgermain teampsg i dare messi to carry that man united side imagine if messi really cared about records most cules are blinded by messi but i was a cule before messi look at how everything went through him our players lost all common sense trying to ingratiate themselves to the goat it was time for messi to move on and for others to shine no way his guy is better than thiago messi better than messi lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time better than messi btw young ronaldo wasnt a better dribbler than messi u clown buhari wants senate to confirm nominees as inec commissioners news buhari inec senate bbnaija messi wizkid davido messi at least one of the zionists you are trying to reason with is afflicted with delusions of supremacy but never give up on telling the truth you so well know the most complete footballer in the world has ever witnessed lionel messi messi i don t even need to list anything cause it s not even an argument btw wiz and burna wizkid is way bigger and has been more consistent just as it is childish to say mbappe is a bigger football great to messi same way it s even more shameful to say burna is better than wiz just like old days at camp nou update chz buys stake in fc barcelona s audiovisual studio for m crypto chz chiliz barca barcelona messi socios cryptonews bitcoin the players in the team were world class even if the team wasn t gelling well enough to be better than a madrid team who had elite players themselves you can t claim to have stated from scratch with henry eto o messi xavi abidal marquez iniesta puyol messi taking back ansu s be like genuine question why is messi so finished argentina home plain or with a messi nameset size large or medium some people are clueless when they start generating millions millions as the likes of salah ronaldo amp messi etc then they will be paid the big

messi ronaldo football eh messi and ronaldo are and now bit different suarez is still far better far better one fact messi is the goat another fact discipline was gone from the barca locker room because of messi fans we just wanted to see messi play in a barca jersey forever the club was imploding financially spiritually as a sports project because of messi messi is still the goat ashravin better than messi will be selling to get messi w messi prop here wow so u mean the squad was weaker than koeman squad after messi left abi bro u capping too much let me just leave u here done the fact of the matter is still messi was a world class player when pep found him so were henry eto o and xavi that s players who could walk into any team in the world at the time plus plenty other decent players that team were semi finalists before the year he found them r was unreal one of the best strikers ever on his day but your mad if your picking him over cristiano him and messi best players ever facts cr is one of the best player in history of football we all know messi is the greatest to ever grace the game no cap just that his mind ain t in that club anymore man left the stadium before the match finished sef you ignored assists and messi being far higher rated who is the best player in the world lionel messi diego maradona pele messi maradona pele swap messi for ronaldo and you have i think people talk too much neymar slams messi s critics after poor debut season messi neymar psg good luck with martial rashford sancho who combined scored league goals last season bro well at least that s more than messi i suppose messi owns him messi and ronaldo don t know u exist so stop dickeating no club would want to sign a player who conducts himself the way cr does its clear his individual aspirations are for him and him alone never have i wanted messi to have a better season than this overhyped him ronaldo is lucky that the media compared him to messi especially in their early years and saying that goals are overrated is the stupidest thing i ve heard why is messi overrated than lionel discuss do what exactly scoring is the most important part of the game but you can t score out of nowhere someone has to create a chance first unless he s been scoring from goal kicks he has done nothing that messi hasn t done how can you watch this and compare it to what messi does is it crack messi in finals games goal assists shots on target successful dribbles key passes big chances created oficial motm involviment with g a avg rating titles zlatan had a league xg of at season messi had a league xg of last season messi didn t have nearly the same amount of goalscoring chances that he s had in other seasons because he played a different role why laporta is tough on de jong and dembele he tusquets bartomeu messi is not good for barca we don t know why but age money locker room influence obvious reasons if laporta says we need de jong and dembele but messi can go barca fans will get very angry with him henry is one of the best players of the s and one of the best forwards of all time eto o is one of the best forwards of that era xavi was euro pott holder messi was ballon d or top what about those players is not world class such a baller man united are so lucky to have a messi regen no weak foot have you ever looked at the xg stats for this ronaldo s weaker foot goals actually fall below expectation messi s weaker foot chances are above expectation since these stats have been compiled lionel messi neymar power paris saint germain to champions trophy over nantes as long as he outscore messi i m good what you looking to hold onto my pocket or something it was released like a month ago that united are the biggest brand in sports due to the enormous worldwide fan base reach and sponsorship deals you had messi fans had i mean i know in years from now let s say messi retires and doesn t win any major titles his goals in a calendar year will be very overrated that season i m not hating it s just the way things are since media has massively overhyped him not messi s fault you can overcome anything if and if only you love something enough lionel messi fcbarcelona messiah as long as he outscore messi i m good premier leagues what are you on messi hasn t played in the prem so he can t have won a premier league in case you didn t know messi world cup ronaldo don score goals pass messi but messi be the best bruh burna boy is the best and biggest shikina me and you know say na him be the biggest if you no still gree because of ur hate or because him no come from your village then you fit cry i shut all fc cry i m just comparing situations ones considered a system player and the other isn t that is media driven it s all for clicks when one is down they gonna go after them whether it be messi or ronaldo look at messi celebration like he scored himself that squad was very very very good calling them good is under selling them by a lot how can you call players who just won the euros messi puyol amp henry a good team as for ronaldinho he was well past his prime at as a barca fan i ve embarked on a research mission to investigate if prime messi was as good as we thought he was after hours of match replays and intense analysis i ve sadly reached the conclusion that he was an ordinary player carried by iniesta and xavi endrick i looked up to a lot of players when growing up neymar messi ronaldo just to name a few however the player i looked up to the most was branislav ivanovic ex apc scribe frank tells inec how to stop rigging osun guber politics apc inec osunguber timifrank bbnaija messi wizkid davido messi must win fifa world cup before he hang his boots messi has bro how do you follow football there s no player in the world got so much slack like him messi wanted to leave and everyone abused barcelona messi scored but no one bats an eye ronaldo scores the most league goals in epl and is still labelled a problem martial fridge and rashford is celebrated current messi is very good and most certainly better than vinicius no disrespect to vini he is fantastic they don t even know the implications of what barcelona are doing they are going to really suffer and fold up in the near future more messi like scenarios will see them with only la masia players in la liga and messi dropped a aswell it s called messi the guy that owns madrid and the one i actually twerk for there is no apartheid in israel they are just playing soccer match you are making a football game political this is the reason why i hate bds they simply can t tolerate others playing football match with israeli footballers messi neymar are for sports not politics not just pep s system it was also the fact he was maturing as a player both can be true at once messi was always going to be great some people had already even started speaking of him that way pep s system was great and he did improve the team but start from scratch nah imagine if messi wins the world cup and if not barca wins the ucl too then returns home to camp nou for the final dance the drugs that will cure messi stans of their false knowledge has not been created context messi is the goat context messi is bigger than pendu debt means nothing it is ability to service it they had salary ratio when messi was there months ago they have only sold the tv rights and only for la liga not the champions league they haven t sold the blm which isn t worth that much to them in revenue anyway messi s father tweeting if you don t think the top goal scorer of all time ucls euros winner and has top scorer in the top leagues isn t even comparable to messi then you are deluded i won t engage says the downie replying to me just admit it s been a decade since messi scored a ucl final goal instead of replying with gifs you my bad nandos or whatever the team messi beat would probably beat manu ngl after they tied with a laliga team lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time messi is not on the list he is the list it s messi and others look forward to playing every thursday night at least messi plays in the cl i guess vini jr amp neymar are x better than messi are you stupid so what if the nr in the league had won every game and psg didn t score a goal but conceded in all of the remaining games psg loses the league didn t messi s goal prevent that this guy has to twerk for messi and varca because his players and his team are irrelevant only messi knows that feeling when they ask me ronaldo or messi me damola is clear sha his half was even better than messi s whole last season messi g a this season mark my words had so many discussions about the quality of woman s football over the years and even if you forget how incredible the pass was the finish is something i ve seen messi do and get plaudits for take a bow englandwomen ronaldo went from messi comps to lacazette if i cared about likes i d praise messi criticising him infront of my followers who are barca fans is not going to get me likes lol are you mentally deficient you were the one that brought up ronaldo s bcm so i brought up messi s i cant argue with someone who thinks its easier to play in this man u team than that psg team who messi don t know him messi was still one of the worlds best output wise while being so so good non output wise a blip in finishing doesn t change that as for salah i think the difficulty in doing what he does in the prem is under appreciated i dont think mbappe is capable of that yet only seen one of these players score a hattrick live and it wasn t messi the next messi messi if you remove the goals against mid table teams bro if barca goes on this year to win la liga and people say damn messi leaving made them better do you know how stupid they would sound that s what y all sound like now about juve x united x cr you gotta take things into consideration and actually be logical messi plays in the cl you don t see how happy barca is without messi i speak for all culers that we don t need messi back messi would give up all his ballon dors to have one of pele s world cups so stay on your own lane pele is clear of messi you completely remove injuries from football who becomes the greatest player of all time is it still messi or does someone else take the throne player world cups gotze messi gotze gt messi fine if you think messi is better but people who think he isn t even comparable to messi are completely deluded exactly but i have to understand why there are more games an finals when you have the time i would love to get stats that will hurt messi fanboys cos im fighting them every god damn day messi is not mbappe he wanted to end his career at barcelona but was forced to leave so if laporta sort out things between him and messi then messi will definetly come back next year this wall of text wont change how messi flopped in ligue afraid the best duo he can t do everything messi can stop saying that bs he s a great player and underrated dribbler for me especially for his height but stop waffling shit go suck messi cock so you mean umtiti should get the hate and messi should be loved i am a man woman lionel messi fan seeking men women messi wins the world cup acting like messi and ronaldo know you exist top role models in life prophet muhammad pbuh luca bish my father jadon sancho therealm homelander mikel arteta kawhileonard lionel messi mitchellyoufool also in and messi scored and goals in he scored goals more than the previous two seasons combined peps system prolly did play a part in that this fucking espn is a big fun of messi fuck off espn stop dragging messi into everything for likes man beast ronaldo g a in games years old as messi now season they were forced to do that when they go to israel stop acting like messi is the only one bruhh cam nou hasn t been filled since messi left do with that information what you will balon dor is just the nail in the coffin tbh pro players were even saying messi didn t deserve it messi is a great man was he not the euro player of the time and i ain t gonna say pep made messi cause i hate it when people say managers made a player but pep wasn t haned that team and messi wasn t anywhere near goat player yet they didn t have an identity yet or any major accomplishments not even trying to argue with you messi hater messi fans are pitiful they have no knowledge of football we have not lost any debate messi scored goals in games and i think he played in finals barca and messi fans worst nightmare definitely messi neymar scores twice as psg easily defeats nantes in the super cup neymar messi psg sergioramos nantes supercup ligue france too old for the ronaldo vs messi debate i know who my goat is ronaldo getting bagged in a friendly while messi is winning man of the match awards at the same time maybe bc he s obsessed w messi idiot while messi doesn t give a damn about him lewy hasn t a chance in the wc with such a dismal team as poland messi and argentina forever the times of ronaldo and messi are slowly coming to an end man i hate it with all my heart even if one plays for united now we will never see a rivalry like that again people will try but no one will ever compare to them im sorry an up and coming talent who had an u wc golden ball finished ballon d or won golden boy award scored a hattrick in el classico we all knew he had an even higher roof but he was already world class also pep came in and messi finished ballon d or at year messi fans owner but how can this be messi fans told me that he was the only reason people watched bar a this season i think messi will perform pretty good messi is not from uae messi is the best player in the french super cup he scored psg s first goal against nantes psg messi he owns messi one question i wish to get answer is why they gave fati the golden number jersey which was suppose to be in respect to messi too disrespectful got lot of amendments to do exactly because football ability messi is times clear unpopular opinion if the team was built around neymar instead of messi barcelona would have won more trophies peak showing support to chelsea this is why messi is the greatest sorry to say but ur idol penaldo stinks the only reason for messi return is how he can generate more revenue for barca that the goal big games barca vs roma barca vs lfc barca vs bayern i guess those ain t big matches however messi is the stop slandering messi for cheap twitter likes messi is coming i won t say for definite that i ll play it like i do normally with mens but i will try it as it is a new thing and you don t exactly know who the messi ronaldos or the barca s of women s football unless you already into women s football so it can be a new challenge messi doesn t have to score goals contribute lol he carried barca so hard when we had jordi alba crying in the locker room at halftime against bayern and dembele missing sitters vs liverpool he left and we was in europa leauge just shows how bad we really were messi s new favourite ig page is reportedly interested in joining instagram instagram transfermarkt argentina transfermarktar primeradivision fichajes players with the most goals in finals lionel messi goals pele goals neymar goals cristiano ronaldo goals romario goals ronaldo goals puskas goals king messi only messi fans think otherwise is messi the best footballer of all time better goal ratio than pendu most ballon d ors most golden shoes ballon d ors without xavi or iniesta goal in a calendar year best playmaker of all time best dribbler of all time stop trying so hard bro it s not working messi clears ronaldo in every midfield metric ronaldo has also never played as a midfielder he said so himself just stop gotze over messi gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt unpopular fact ronaldo is better than messi y all dumb cr fans only talk bout his goals apart from his goals messi is clear bruh what you chatting arsenal was here before messi and will still be here many years after messi is great but not bigger than a club bro pessi fans messi forever when tf has he done that at brighton everytime ive watched him he was lb lwb lmaoooo last time round fulham made willian look like messi in that pm opening day away slot messi is still a brilliant finisher bro marquinhos

the tournaments only footballer with lazarus sports person of the year factos keep crying like all sad ronnie fanboys if all perform messi neymar mbappe could become better hes played more fucking games and messi is years younger i know but i only defend messi i don t talk shit about ronaldo i respect him a lot penaldo is egoistic messi is bigger goat than penaldo and he is humble as well messi would never leave barca even if they finish in europa league and he would play in the respect of club but this penaldo is shite no one wants him go and kiss your kings arse he ll never get near the real king of football messi messi and i you neymar neymar goles y asistencia messi man of the match mister marketing messi has been up against all retardeds that don t know anything about football all of his carrer too that s why he has more goals all time than anyone he s broken peles record you messi dick riders are just too dense to admit it messi fans right now he s the goat he can do everything messi can do and more gotze owns argentina and messi see how happy barca is without messi i speak for all culers that we don t need messi back lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time he weren t good enough to win playing in messi era that s a joke look at these seasons ffs ya but c mon man it s really mainly about quality than quantity if you think about it as much as messi wins ballon d or or scores goals in a calendar year it s honestly very overrated to me now he s a wonderful player but no way he should keep getting this amount of praise team messi basically when a player looks like he has all the time in the world when he s on the ball i e messi pedri xavi iniesta foden etc this alone earns messi the ballon d or messi was ballon d or number in and ballon d or number to in when pep came in i was a staunch ronaldo fan at the time and even i could tell he d win the ballon d or soon i was already confused as to who was better don t even i didn t mention villa i never understood the media hype up cristiano vs messi when messi isnt even the best in the last years the best players are cristiano amp zidane then the rest is following like ronaldo ronaldinho henry etc but at the very top standing cr closely followed by zidane joan laporta exclusive barcelona president on re signing messi being offered ronaldo and avoiding bankruptcy i don t think messi fans deserve love excluding the goalkeeper messi has never beaten up to players and scored in his entire career also ronaldo has the ability to beat players and score comfortably ronaldo has more ucl final goals than messi more wc goals than messi more league goals than messi messi only benefitted from spanish and blatter tax messi was legit the best player on the pitch that game without a shadow of a doubt supposed to be messi messi win ucl for i just mean messi fans in general it s all you lot do messi is the best creative player of all time and ronaldos the best goal scorer and nobody comes close to either sure you can bring up the years messi has scored more but ronaldos doing what he does at and soon to be yeah cus livescore will be mentioned and remembered in years to come as creditable silly sausage i think ronnie would prefer messi s ballon d ors messi only have more than ronaldo mohamed salah sends message to fans after signing new contract epl sport fans mohamedsalah bbnaija messi wizkid davido and what s lio messi doing there please give us fabio gama etuga and mbela as man of the match that s alright bro nike makes nice boots too but daaamn adidas has my heart especially them messi was a big factor i choose adidas too tho anyways score me some hattrick lol you know xavi and iniesta were unlucky to be in their prime when messi was unstoppable it s already hard to win a ballon dor for a midfielder but to try compete to someone who was scoring goals is hard and the biggest reason of abuse towards messi or ronaldo is their toxic fanbases including accounts like you cr easy brazil ronaldo was amazing don t get me wrong but cr it much better amp does more in a game too he has over goals amp that itself is something no other player as in they locker that is why cr is the best player ever only other player imo who comes close is messi messi fighting everybody messi is in uber eats and flopped messi didn t even mention him mate imagine if barca eventually signs messi would he go for that barca museum tour and see his own ballon d ors a rooster de jong messi fuck pippawy messi has less bcm and less goals you do the maths year old messi league goals vs league goals year old ronaldo but na true na have u not seen hazard play his close control is only second to messi but this guy is good sha but he s nearer to raphinha than prime

case for ronaldo virtually no top player is a stylistic fit to any system except the one that was altered to fit them in the first place for example messi s free role requires a lot of compensating as well as neymar you hate ronaldo more than you love messi throughout the tournament messi was always the mvp for argentina what could ve he done more tell me garbage ass fucking player idgaf this same

leaving liverpool for new club epl sport epl firmino liverpool bbnaija messi wizkid davido blud puts messi s whole career defeats i would release a dictionary of cr s that s first of all messi didn t play as bad as cr in his defeats messi has to carry his team for example liverpool who could ve possibly carry barca if it s not messi better than prime messi why does the media need to lie about messi if he sucked like you all want to claim then why hype someone like that you guys are llorones to a new level cry more i m enjoying the tears yeah icl i saw it and instantly thought it was about messi thought he was replying to the other tweet yes ooo wizkid n messi my overall point is that ronaldo has had a easier pathway in this utd team than messi last season and ronaldos made utd team worse and man utd isn t shit as you make it seem like and they constantly give him chances and he s had bcm i ve proves this throughout this thread you say this while you watched messi lob a ball while alba runs then cuts it back to him xper game games per season and they rigged the champions league for ronaldo yrs straight so they can give messi competition and find out messi is still clear okupe withdraws as obi s vp candidate politics obi okupe bbnaija messi wizkid davido it confirms he s the goat because every fan and media outlet outside of real madrid and man united think messi is the goat that doesn t add up lol messi has goals in last years although he had pens fair on an individual level messi was ahead i dont understand is it me or am i to tired golas in games in finals its because i will make a meme to all those retarded messi fanboys for me lionel messi of course would love to fvck him tonight and every night delutional then why he implied messi is coming back messi ein own bunch pass ugo go them million views nkoa whoever likes mourinho likes messi then support chelsea will like burna understand this philosophy this names here creates and keep records but can never get support attention from the media they only watch and wait for them flop even the so called bloggers were silent today that s the tough part of the equation sarabia s primary role in possession was complementary pushing the defensive line to open up space between lines for neymar messi mbappe will probably want to touch the ball more than sarabia we will soon see what galtier s solution is marquinhos analyzes the one major factor behind messi s promising performance in psg s trophee des champions final win psgtalk psg parissaintgermain merciparis messi owns my idol why doesn t he buy himself out of the contract he d even get a discount amp leave sooner just like messi could ve retired at barca if he played for free they choose then complain cry over ok messi and neymar have no won the ucl for the last seven years and they are in the top five of the best well paid footballers they are ripping their club i m talking about the trophies alone forget about g a you said that nobody gives a fuck about copa america and i can literally say the exact same thing about bundesliga argentina wouldn t have won copa america without messi but bayern would have won bundesliga without lewa they are both great messi has just always been above him but there both goats in their own way lmao guy when it comes to football abilities ronaldo no reach half of messi messi better only lionel messi and pele have scored more goals in finals than neymar you never know that one thing i do know for sure is that messi has more then cr the three king s lessons in style lionel messi klopp some faves messi own both just like how messi wasn t the reason for aroma liverpool and bayern but guess who s face was everywhere let s be honest messi is a system player cause thats the way to play football if he was in the market every team would fight for his signature for that fact he makes any team better he s leaving broke barcelona he said he would do his best and he did did messi accept the contract yes or no exactly stfu messi said he s to the new barca contract la liga said no u can t do it under ffp and they tend to push barca to sign the cvc and he choose the club ovver

speak ill of messi g your cancelled nah man messi can t provide functions to the team like he did when he was younger i think age has really hit him better can do everything salah can and more and i do think benz is debatable messi isn t so gavin if i get what your saying now your messi is the one that controls a game then you don t know anything about football it s like you watch football with your eyes closed when have you seen messi change a game if a team is down messi goes down ronaldo changes game messi fighting since kid for his dream but yes he had it easy congrats for be one of the worst tw acc no way filipo gaylando still believes this bullshit about pr how can u be so dumb and not know its all for clicks tapinaldo will never be like messi or near messi in anything just hold and keep quiet messi is the goat that s why for being at one club all his life proves why he has better goal ratio right imagine if messi went to different clubs he wouldn t sniff his ballon d or at most he ll have like lol bro get another messi and this looks legit messi is not coming back rest title b b lead email messi usa china ukraine fifa ronaldo linkedin israeli business companybroadway ronaldo better over the years but no one beats prime messi my man was on a different level messi has more goals in finals than ronaldo as well you stupid ronaldo last season still out scored messi at in the prem and in ucl let s not forget messi practically knocked psg out of ucl with that penalty miss messi got goals in a farmers league messi could never for the records are you really saying here that ronaldo has more on pitch records despite the general knowledge of messi creating and dribbling more asides goals you must be joking here golden boot is a journalist award you re just being bias here you know the truth they got themselves in such a mess that they had to let messi go why wouldn t they have the capacity to screw this summer up lol de jong is sticking true to his principles he s owed money and barca are going to have to start selling players messi it took him all game to actually get anywhere donarumma started well but towards the end that man turnt into dean henderson be scared messi and co the real is in town ramsey and rodon in france now means messi is the best player in that league now messi in was better individually output wise the gap wasn t that big to cover the monstrous gap in non output involvement i think u forgot messi i m ngl messi gets special treatment we not gonna agree but it is what it is just watch how this season goes for both of them we ll see what s up definitely not messi messi always been a way better play he owned ronaldo all the time scoring tapins will not make her better than messi and messi and argentina were toying with italy lmao the media was also swayed because alot of messi former team mates would constantly gas him and it just became the norm ronaldo was always that one guy who did it all on his own people going on about masuaku leaving like we ve lost messi ffs the fella is dogshit and that s being unkind to dogshit m i abaga net worth biography amp list of cars net worth biography miabaga celebritycars networth biography m i abagacars bbnaija messi i know that but he wants to see messi play i reckon he ll leave next summer an he s a nightmare to buy for anyway so makes sense download comedy video mr macaroni mide martins is my new wife comedy comedy video mrmacaroni mrmacaronicomedyvideos downloadpage bbnaija messi wizkid davido what makes me laugh most is fans say zidane has amazing technical ability but the truth is there are players with elite technical ability and zidane doesn t even come close maradona messi ronaldo delima zico guti baggio totti van basten iniesta bergkamp compare both at that age ronaldo same scenario left real went to a different country and produced these numbers lionel messi at the same age as ronaldo had goals all season last season compare that i m still trying to figure out what messi is good at because it s definitely not football ronaldo will play with a midfield of fred bruno eriksen while messi plays with the best player itw messi dunked on your fake country messi is till the best in world football id say benzema salah are ahead too the likes of rodri kdb vvd have a case all that just for messi have a better goal ratio and more golden boots the difference between outside and inside the box is just a line messi takes many of his shots from the edge of the box ronaldo is better from long range he also scores from any angle this clown just compared messi s ats to ronaldo s stats of so far look at the clown he s unbelievable lol ansu is better than messi i feel like some coaches managers don t know how to handle such brand players like cr amp messi lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time its good to see messi getting the ball in forward positions you can see how much better he plays great coaching from galtier messi woulane messi was comfortably ahead as an individual footballer messi was not the highest rated player lol it was iniesta he won motm your favourite stat lol then neymar most publications have rakitic or suarez idk where you getting your info messi was comfortably ahead as an individual footballer he sold out for the money and accepted being leonardo s puppet wasted a year of messi s few years left you re actually arguing for no reason and yes as of the time you finished you had the most expensive in football that s not a myth when you calculated how much you spent on each player unlike when psg got messi on a free neymar and lionel messi shine in psg s win vs nantes what a wonderful view with messi in front of messi everyone falls lmao i m laughing at all you cristiano fans it must be so hard to see messi succeed messi doesn t have to remind anyone that he is king goat the world knows only people trying to say different it s cristiano and his fans people really comparing old ronaldo in a dead united team to lionel messi in a start studded psg side ronaldo will always be better good riddance i don t miss you warnock slams departing chelsea man united stars epl sport chelsea epl manunited warnock bbnaija messi how to test the quality of your soccer projections is it better than a dummy model does it really love lionel messi is that lionel messi hoping to enlist the help of girls already involved outside of school linking to community clubs etc also just keeping it in the conversation referring to the lionesses instead of cr and messi all time let s encourage some future lucy bronzes and beth meads unpopular opinion if the team was built around neymar instead of messi barcelona would have won more trophies i got you hommie anything for messi fans pikin mistakenly say na only mumu go pick messi over ronaldo to him papa na d matter we still dey solve like this players with the most goals in finals lionel messi goals pele goals neymar goals cristiano ronaldo goals romario goals ronaldo goals puskas goals big game players no mercy messi on this waves and that is how the sea rows cros lyrical joe messi neymar and debryune trolled troll by not delivering the cl you think messi wasn t even close to the ballon dor last year so i wouldn t talk too much about bad takes be grateful that messi is not arrogant as ronaldo or else neymar wouldn t get any chances on freekicks or penalties messi literally revived neymar s career have some shame right on messi s head bring messi or neymar with you please but couldn t afford messi s wages embarrassment because football pages normally have dedicated football fans running them so they wouldn t have these casual awful takes about ronaldo being anywhere as good as messi microsoft wants to buy messi ronaldo for their squad but sony thinks microsoft having them in their squad will become too op wen partnership k fan tokens winner take all at end of tournament argentina baby goalllllll messi ever last night i went to a restaurant in london after i ate my food the waitress asked if i wanted more i said i m messi and barcelona then she knew i was finished and broke oga messi has always been lucky always play for a better team ignore messi missing his pen in the first leg as well while you re at it last night i went to a restaurant in london after i ate my food the waitress asked if i wanted more i said i m messi and barcelona then she knew i was finished and broke from the fan of lionel messi to his teammate hugo ekitike psg ligue ladies and gentlemen the greatest footballer of all time and a fraud by the name of leo messi all i see is that they didn t win it last year just like they didn t win the league the season before messi you don t know much about history messi in was similar to a up and coming player he still had a lot to learn which he did under pep as manager what happened to barcelona after pep left they became less dominant and a one man team messi bankrupted barca and is dragging psg down last night i went to a restaurant in london after i ate my food the waitress asked if i wanted more i said i m messi and barcelona then she knew i was finished and broke messi in big games yes why would you compare that to messi salary god forbid if people have small miner thought of messi being bad person and you not being fukin biased assswwhhoollleeess yeah his longshots are better then messi but that s it that kid is going to remember and talk about this moment for the rest of his life this is what makes messi goat apart from his out of this world skills messi return to home bar number of games played to achieve g a lionel messi cristiano ronaldo how will someone compare this mf to messi how messi was still considerably better than both of them in all seasons and as for the dominating international messi didn t have a super team like they did otherwise he would ve dominated it as well don t act like they carried spain alone neymar messi has nothing to prove to anyone you cant be serious they are legends but not maradonna and messi level bruno also had more penalties but i guess that doesnt fit your agenda also what was psg s game plan from buying messi winning the ucl messi missed that crucial penalty and cost them that game messi better he literally conpared ronaldo s january to august and messi ronaldo lives rent free this admin is such a fake fan lol tries to be messi villa didn t come till everyone knows messi took an unreal jump from to iniesta wasn t that guy yet and the fact is he took over a barcelona team that finished with points in matches and took them to messi had this stats all games for psg last season so chill out kid i wouldn t use the word begging messi is immensely popular e fans see suddenly there is money e fans suspect that the club cooked the books to justify getting rid of messi laporta doesn t want to piss off a whole different team is a huge stretch a different philosophy is fair and i agree with your stats point but that was only sent because the guy i was talking to tried to use stats from the end of the year to discredit messi ten hag reveals man utd player that has impressed him epl sport epl manutd tenhag bbnaija messi wizkid davido that s terrible that they are not taking the best play by play announcer it s like saying messi won t go to the wc but his team will do a good move by

messi wizkid davido messi is not in top in goat debate in my book lmfaooo even if lewa won it messi wouldn t have been robbed it could have gone both ways he won t go next season or next seasons i don t know after that though neymar might head to us after because he mentioned it but messi haven t said anything yet but suarez said it s not happening now unpopular opinion skills wise neymar is the second best of our generation after messi of course no way you just said di stefano and puskas are better than messi they played in a farmers era doubtful i m hoping doesn t hit us with a messi pele renaldo and try and get for each of those an uncommon opinion considers neymar the best player in the last decade after messi neymar outperforms cristiano same messi who retired twice when the pressure got too much for him i m sorry but no player can get even close to prime messi he was scary it goes both ways like when messi lost that copa final and his crying pic was everywhere just how the game goes these days great game great player messi is goat ronaldo is goat he just put messi s all season stats in and compared to ronaldos half stats unbelievable bs i swear this admin is here for followers he s barely a fan i can t find penaldo in frame at s why messi is the goat to win the messi will win the and the best awards what do u rate messi in ucl final being a messi fan i feel sorry for you guys that you idolise a player just by stats and not how these players do some unreal stuff on the field both messi and ronaldo are great but messi is something different no one will ever do things messi has done ever again he s otw you know this was during when messi was playing for barca right man united fan speaking about ucl messi owns ur club no complains with lionel messi i love him but this media treatment sucks ok and clearly shows neymar was better messi missed big chances and had some more dribbles and passes but didnt creaty anything dangerous neymar on the other hand scored won the pen and created big chances when are we setting a space to tackle this ronaldo and messi debate once and for all do you know messi scored againts only one good team man city rest of his goals and his assist came from not top team in league so you don t have a normal point so would you like to shut the fuck up the only way to bring messi back to camp nou last night i went to a restaurant in paris after i ate my food the waitress asked if i wanted more i said i m lionel messi then she knew i was finished i m not seeing any pathetic here except you it s just facts and you people are in denial he was the best rated player in the match even xavi said after the match that messi was brutal and he was the key of the game i enjoy seeing you people trying to fight fax it s really sad facts the medias always make look like the arrogant man the overrated player when at the same time they make messi look like the goat bring us back that signed messi shirt mate lmao copa merchant accolades in the bottom section are copa america stats a shit competition held every years that no one cared about it till messi won no one cared when chile won they just gave him the ballon d or because he finally won an international trophy that bottom tier keeper had least goals scored against him in all ligue last year he s been a wall messi made him look bad here messi has more junhinho has more carlos has more etc why xavi and laporta begging messi to comeback gio reyna with your great dribbling skills against mexico you r going b the next ousmane dembele and messi please get healthy gio and stay healthy and come back and show the soccer world your great dribbling and ball skills gio your saying the best player of all time won t start ahead of dembele messi s best football came under tiki taka play which is what xavi does messi league goals there s no more messi wake up it s the same way you guys comfortably say messi is overhyped man ronaldo is overhyped because he doesn t have any other abilities apart from scoring he s almost useless in games in which he doesn t score i guess messi makes up for this one espn admin is most annoying and dumb person on the planet bro wich team is nantes did you forget last season i respect messi to much but bro how old are you my opinion is the king is who play in pl and get twist best player and with shit team like

really fvxked with football messi gets more hate in the media idc what the casuals say messi is the best big game player ever a player that starts his goals and playmakes for majority of the game is better than a striker waiting to poach goals complete performances gt tapins ayo i m dumb af thought you were one of those people saying it s not a sport my b i m not bothering with messi anymore he has nothing b but messi has ballondors i d have you know that i bought messi mbappe and de brunye in one window on fifa why utd can t do deals like that is beyond me i even bought salah just to put him in the reserves i think messi hold the record for goal scored in final outside the box messi had ronaldinho ronaldo had carrick i actually really hope messi and neymar cook but i hope chelsea win the ucl regardless who tf are you don t just type do some research first messi join psg when they were not champion do you realize that still neymar produced an assist one penalty goal and one freekick goal the whole world would be twerking if messi did that things between messi and man utd were never the sane again messi is the man of the match juste the goat why this stat is deceiving and messi isn t a big game player thread the real fans know the truth no matter how hard u try with all the pr and all the money u have the good football knows who is the real goat and finished messi goals on farmers league being carried once again isnt love their relationship he isn t a better goalscorer then him messi has nearly same non pen goals then him in less than less matches it s not a trash reason i m giving you litteral facts and your giving your opinions that win percentage came after ronaldo came and ruined the club s game plan somewhere out there is a ronaldo fan arguing that this clip shows ronaldo is a better passer than messi but teams aren t rejecting him psg that rejected ronaldo is in serious negotiations for messi s extension yes bro neymar and mbappe who messi was the main guy did that was shit so used players to do plus player got messi good to put on my team for me to use twice a week messi to complete the humiliation in november by god s grace legit messi won his team more games insane be it known that messi s ballon dor campaign has started already you ll have to hold unfortunately i will never stand for messi disrespect especially after what he did for us that year why are we taking what espn says seriously in the first place bro messi s face is literally everywhere when his team loses he s drug through the media abiodun felicitates muslims

urself as a messi fanboy rather than ur love ronaldo there p saying messi is nothing special is an insult to football three defenders in front of him amp lafont is the goalkeeper who conceded the least goals in ligue last season but h ters here acting like this was easy and messi s feints amp precision angles had nothing to do with the goal the goat doing goat things in another final best playmaker of this generation behind messi check your bank account we paid for lewandowski barcelona hits back at bayern laliga sport barcelona bayern laliga lewandowski bbnaija messi wiz see how espn dey ride messi so unprofessional lmao did espn make a tweet about messi scoring goals throughout an entire season in france no they didn t they had segments asking if naldos goals were hurting united let s be real its been a while since i ve seen a right footed player this slick its like all the left footed ones copy messi alien quality goat for a reason ofc its easier for ronaldo to score but that is only because he is a way better goalscorer than messi and stop giving these trash reasons man united also went years with no trophy and they have a win percentage below percent without ronaldo this season lionel messi wins heart with another beautiful gesture football lionelmessi psg paris ligue fifa that s why messi has outside the box goals more messi coming home for his last season but the club doesn t exist anymore i saw people getting neymar messi dembele in reminder lewandowski was on a team coming off a sextuple while messi was on the worst barca we ve seen in years nearly every goal we scored was either messi scoring it messi assisting it or messi creating it absolute carry job from january to may finally another messi fan shegz is a fighter his loyalty to bro code is unmatched dude just earned my respect they wanted to put groovy even his babe omo shegz dribble them like messi blood shegz someday groovites would return the favour messi with dj snake so it s not toxic to say messi is bigger than barca why would this he helpful to building a title run xavi and iniesta won euro with xavi named player of the tournament messi had just finished and in the ballon d or at years old he had already won the olympics and u wc as player of the tournament they were already established players when he arrived foh nah it s true the disrespect to cr in these days is

mercato psg mauricio pochettino comes out of silence and talks about mbapp messi and the failure of paris in the champions league messi won tbh plan is for the sporting project to immediately generate revenue through sponsorships increased ticket sales prize money from liga and going further in cl it s a calculated risk but better than the alternative bringing messi back will also significantly

the truth according to messi i d keep him a thousand miles from any locker room is messi alone then laporte is a clown catalan politician he wants to be re elected and will carry on till the end with his lies remember last year messi is definately staying blabla etc in one night psg grabbed him you do you little titty head imagine how little messi would be without them growth hormones foot nothing looking ass paris saint germain psg secured their first silverware of the season with a resounding win over nantes in the trophee des champions in tel aviv on sunday it is not about being messi it is about just being complete winger the guy was about to do siuu but realised now he s teammates with messi no if s and but s at the moment messi is at psg and cr at man u end of discussion i don t know why we messi fans troll ronaldo so much his playmaking is so underrated i mean just look at this messi winning all these awards and trophies from shit no one s ever heard of finallisima and coup le baguette like wtf is this messi pr just making shit up now to award their boy since when did messi become so toxic never seen him doing such things in years of his professional football player see what neymar said about messi that is seriously trending all bias aside cristiano ronaldo is ruining is legacy since he could ve left madrid with a ucl threepeat or even more and then end his career graciously but he s so obsessed with messi that he kept playing and ruining his legend status at united and destroyed juventus i d say messi and ramos have a mad amount of respect for each other two legends of the game messi s mix tape i m a fraud i need you ft xavi amp iniesta thank you sepp blatter rejected again ft laporta new challenge ft ligue living in the box ft penalty spot ghostman give

discord id messi goat you don t know ball if you don t realise messi deserved the ballondor that year do u think messi is the same as umtiti forget messi or ronaldo this is still the greatest footballer ever messi had bcm and goals ronaldo had goals and bcm what is your point bring out your own stats still only barca messi stans will agree that messi deserved it over lewa lmaooo so if messi is bigger than barca let s suppose you re right why would barca want a guy who will completely destroy the proper gravity in the locker room so regardless of race or sport the loss of athletic icons should mean something to people lmao messi and cr don t know you bro finnalisma messi had two assist fyi ronaldo has goals and assists in international finals isn t messi supposed to not show up in big games messi s game vs chelsea in gt ronaldo final games officially moved to the us today for college unreal feeling excited and nervous but one thing that won t change is that messi is the goat ronaldo is more skilful and more complete than messi messi is just overrated a child storms the stadium after yesterday s match and the legend messi demands security to leave him to take a picture with him i genuinely think there are people in this app that would die for messi and ronaldo you have to be joking messi plays with a guy who dropped g a in games ligue is significantly easier than the prem and his team is way better how tf has he had it easier messi and suarez friendship is wonderful he only has two goals the assist was not counted since it touched the defender again what s up with ronaldo fans watching the so called farmers league wasting their time but kinda proves how angry they still are by messi jorge messi is paying a huge amount to this pr trams messi doesn t know u sadly plus ur vote doesn t matter how do people even compare him to messi i mean bartomeu was literally paying these shitty portals to suck off messi and barca at first i thought it was fake but when you look at their posts it makes sense if you really think messi organized that photoshoot you re a fucking idiot i don t from where does those ansu hypes coming from lol ansu is not even of vinicius lol messi s number jersey really hyped him rass is a messi too we ve all seen ronaldo do things in the most important games in football that messi just can t do go bring your true stats then the even excluded messi goals against estonia in that picture the said official matches you now flexing friendlies and then when he doesn t perform like prime messi every game they ll abuse him tell the club to sell him our twitter fanbase is so moronic bunch of kids who don t know shit about football aside maguire asensio is the biggest fraud to grace this earth nigga used two weeks to play like messi ronaldo and maradona combined together now he s back to default playing like cosmos dauda bc messi is literally a brick wall most boring athlete to exist say something interesting for once fifa president bashed ronaldo on live television he called him a robot and said messi got balon dor votes because he s a nice guy this is a real video y all talking about us watching the match if neymar played better and messi got the goals and assist he will still be given then man of the match that s the bias he s talking about messi winning trophy while banterlona going trophyless yeah messi also carried ronaldinho to the cl in even the spain to the world cup right dumb ass mendes has practically zero friends in the media but some twats from the messi fanbase will tell you otherwise them of all people whose idol has practically the best pr team in the history of world football after this summer i have lost all respect for barca it started with messi but now they keep talking about buying players not being able to register the players they do have and they don t want to pay the players they owe barca is trash you are not writing breaking news or entertainment news so avoid referencing celebrities sports or politics let me use myself as a nigerian as an example when i hear football what i envision is ronaldo and messi messi i didn t have the best year but i ll be better next season his stans he had a ballon dor winning season the gap in team trophies between these is significant plus messi has won more team trophies than penaldo anyways lol he s being nice messi was always supposed to be a superstar ever since he first came through i remember him scoring a hattrick vs madrid as a teenager toty ronaldo and tots messi you think messi was scoring to goals before pep arrived check the followers of both the accounts that were having a ratio battle not messi and ronaldo do you not know nothing about twitter mate not a ronaldo fan using sofascore for why neymar played better than messi messi look same everybody is a failure it all depends on your definition of failure dangote is a failure when compared to elon musk or bill gates naymer is a failure when compared to messi or ronaldo so what s your definition of failure warra league goal for messi who needs stepovers and fake shots if you have messi s dribbling ok messi fans or shiz like that may ise g a to keep up or what bullcrap ur talking bout but last time o chdcked assist make up goals goals make up wins not always sp keep crying i know i ve complained about messi before but we might see peak messi this season he s off to a great start messi for me god i hope this makes united fans realise they no longer have to pretend hes as good as messi it s a mystery why they didn t consider neymar the team could use a proper number he could play so many different roles for this team and is still arguably the best no after messi marquinhos analyzes the one major factor behind messi s promising performance in psg s trophee des champions final win how is it harder be ronaldo pendu literally only striker and all balls go thru him to score while messi literally in half way all game and has to go past players to score while ronaldo getting tap ins in the box plus messi is messi never had it easy ansu fati is better than messi ronaldo was one messi award away from winning balon dors in a row see messi face messi is overrated new york red bulls vs barcelona extended highlight neymar didn t get an assist it was deflected by a defender it was already covered it was in no way getting to messi it also provides them with a secure structure for defensive transitions and enables neymar amp messi to stay higher up the pitch in vitinha amp verratti psg have two excellent ball progressers messi amp neymar should receive plenty of possession i liked the look of psg s new shape against nantes the shape provides constant width wing backs allows messi amp neymar to drift infield the three cbs make them difficult to press resulting in verratti receiving a lot of possession he had a great game messi does not play for you barca dream of a return for leo messi in galtier s psg don t miss mbappe as messi neymar and ramos run riot against nantes i ll put my morals and hatred aside just for messi messi deserves the accolades that he received messi deserves the ballon d ors messi deserves the title the goat messi deserved to get paid at psg messi fans have the right to become psg supporters it s hard to argue with barca presidents that messi was bad for barcelona team messi is the a side i think messi is shit right now and i want him to leave my club and i m not a fanboy but i still know he s the goat so who has it easier right now messi or ronaldo chelsea no comparison to barca a small stadium in london compared to the biggest club stadium in europe also look at who has played for barca in the past cryuff maradonna ronaldo the real one rivaldo ronaldinho iniesta xavi messi etc her i support real madrid too messi plays for them who else would you be rooting for by slandering messi i don t even understand the agenda on balondor as well messi literally the only one in modern football to represent that award well individual award meant for the best player on the field not the player with the most goals there s a reason the golden boot exists it s like trying to actively discredit messi or ronaldo there is no way to do it that doesn t bring out the clownery in you and that s putting it lightly after years messi fans will realise how important player cristiano ronaldo was to football and how good he was your daughter said messi sucks so messi is still a wonderful player hello this is messiverse an account created to post audiovisuals records stats and more from the iconic lionel messi leo deserves to be remembered as the greatest footballer ever by all generations the same media pages that show messi s face all that time when his team concedes but show maguires face when united concede same fifa president that extended a bdor first time ever and fifa later gave him a special award and made a lineup of forwards just to include him messi the fifa baby fifa s most protected player overrated this season ghost of paris ghost against the best france teams u have to said messi stole ballondor last year again keep living in the past he cant score more goals than ibra not even alcoholic neymar on farmers league next year we will see him on mls finishing his career while cr is gona still be the greatest he left to go watch messi psg galtier reveals one major similarity between messi neymar cry g messi is a dribble merchant if you think that ronaldo is not better then you are a blinded messi fan ronaldo had played in different leagues and has performed great in everyone messi is been in same team for years everyone on that team played for him when messi left barcelona his went to almost sunday the king plays only for ronaldo to drop a minute stinker leave the stadium early and messi to score in a cup final ronaldo joined manu to get more spotlight than messi truth is he failed and now trying to walk away benzema is the player that

messi s dad s page just seeing squad for the upcoming season i feel somebody like would fit them perfectly for both or system wherein they can swap between and paredes in both the systems he can be the link between the defence and messi in football if you have no talent you don t get on even if you are lionel messi s son in politics and the media family can get an idiot on the payroll then you admit that messi is clear of penaldo too btw neymar has taken messi s no o a real messi fan will respect ronaldo and vice versa it s bare minimum imo mate this was in the media pundits where genuinely asking eachother who was the best between rooney and messi okes can we please move away from the amigos i love messi but aowa let s build with abopedri and fati as our new leaders this photo should be called the incredibles sergio ramos strikes a beautiful photo with fellow legends messi and neymar instagram legitng legitposts sergioramos messi c mon bro if the manager of psg who has mbappe messi and neymar wins the league and points behind him is reims who just got balogun on loan you can t just ignore that each manager are afforded different tools amp what they achieve with it has to be looked at who is the better player lionel messi rt big jon parkin fav grandeeee ronieee the man who changed for good after cruyff and before messi did yeah but with iniesta and xavi messi won champions league the first he wasn t even relevant without xavi and iniesta champions league it was an outstanding match and i was so impressed with the fact that messi had the first goal neymar has scored in different finals cristiano scored in different finals messi scored in different finals ligue takes any chance to give messi a potm trophy so they can try and keep their league relevant paris saint germain manager christophe galtier has revealed one major similarity between forwards lionel messi and neymar galtier said both messi and neymar have a real technical link he said this after both players scored in psg s trophee love from a messi fan sad to see ronaldo go out like this could find the same accounts slandering messi and praising cr just depends on your agenda messi would start from the bench you re a very big clown like a bigger one lol messi is the one who got goat shoutouts first then got dragged into a debate he doesn t care about only to end up standing at the top while ronaldo became obsessed with it coz of the media and also ronaldo s records are always threatened if u pay attention to football why isn t he meant to assist that s part of the game messi isn t the striker so i can see he ain t meant to score ask messi yes messi scored goals in the farmers league messi would have dribbled through and created a chance ronaldo just a glorified cherry picker with low creativity messi won ballon d or last year pendu can t relate so you ruling messi out too then shows you are talking utter nonsense galtier s psg don t miss mbappe as messi neymar and ramos run riot against nantes bet now via tots rafael leao x on my acc on my mates acc i got both tots mbappe and tots messi in x you said messi and ronaldo and then said real athletes your point is not valid stfu messi has more balon d or s golden boots and ronaldo has never won playmaker of the year like messi has think it s pretty clear who s the better footballer barcelona are already everything for leo messi s return next summer for free laporta wants messi to spend his last years at his beloved club messi will make a decision after the world cup psg wants to renew his contract for more year transfers i m just tryna help but keep living in past messi is finished keep dreaming while one is still at the top being the greatest on every team messi is walking on french league next year mls at he will be retired and cr at that age is top scorer on the hardest league on earth from idol to teammate leo messi espn writing articles about messi and ronaldo doing the same things i still stand on that but rn i fear messi is better at least at controlling where the game goes he didn t need to overcommit it s silva not messi ramos was about to do suuuiiiii then remembered messi is on the team too i m so glad my that i m not dumb enough to argue that ronaldo is better than messi there genuinely is no one close to the goat kindly follow back like my latest tweet messi will snap his hips trying that man messi would never this guy a joker and some would say he the best why wouldn t i modric was decent at the clutch for madrid and messi is a better player midfielder plus i expect busi piqui to leave so his leadership will be a bonus as well that s why messi will flop again this season no integrity in his legacy but messi he could be better than messi in da other room guys not necessarily on the pitch espn love messi more than their own mothers ebubeagu herdsmen killings in imo enugu unacceptable ohanaeze news ebubeabu enugu herdsmen imo ohanaeze bbnaija messi wizkid davido psg galtier reveals one major similarity between messi neymar oh wow let s give ronaldo messi s golden boots because we voted for him to have more someone said messi s prime salah s prime they never played in europa league until messi left madrid never had such a downgrade when cristiano left on the contrary they are winning more than ever they ve won la ligas since cristiano left same number of la ligas as cristiano had in years messi is now far away him coming back to barca is impossible a year gone and now we are signing great players again though it is not easy to overturn any crisis so i expect barcelona to take it gradually may take years to perfect their finance books and the period may reduce if they succeed to re sign lionel messi next year messi has a whooping seasons of better dribble than ronaldo s highest moves like messi the dude is built like a bodybuilder another one of his problems got close control and can carry the ball but not good change of direction that s why messi is finished sure kid thats why he is top scorer on everyteam he plays no matter his teammates while messi needs xavi and iniesta to be great even stoling balondor from them messi and iniesta were already first team regulars by the time pep came along you re right about busquets though that s it messi tots from the messi and neymar this season it s fucking and messi is still the best player in the world lmao why do people cry about this messi is the one who got goat shoutouts first then got dragged into a debate he doesn t care about only for ronaldo to be obsessed with it ronaldo disrespect is so forced lol rattles messi s fanbase each day he can speak english he took the time and made the effort messi seems humble because he is quiet and shy acting giving them less fuel to go on people who say that ronaldo is better than messi just know shit about football messi goal celebration vs nigeria at world cup when moments meet cardboard bro is getting trolled because he was rejected by every ucl club and then wants to insta post some insecure shit of course the internet is on his ass banter avoids no one and messi has had his fair share of it ain t no media is against ronaldo messi is the only god i believe in lionel messi has not been rejected by atletico de madrid bayern munich psg barcelona real madrid but penaldo is top all time remember the kid who made a messi jersey out of a plastic bag messi shows up messi has a way better goal to game ratio and more npg messi beats ronaldo in every statistic except heading penalties and his record in ages of the champions league when you compare goals assists dribbles per lionel messi had a message for luis suarez after he returned home to nacional once again besides the point i dont see how it being ronaldo s fault changes the matter of fact ronaldo at is playing for a worst team than messi has ever had at club level messi at will most likely go back to barcelona and they will most likely be a superteam by then cristiano ronaldo is smaller than messi s right foot messi was better in this game as well lmao shameless dives and pens don t change that my god these deluded weirdos don t watch football the pr they receive literally everytime barca lost in the champions league it was a messi picture shut the fuck up really wanna visit p g s stadium for messi but my hatred wont let me have you ever thought that messi will play alongside ramos this is the same thing with lewandoski and football is all about interest it s all about football conspiracy theory messi scored plenty goal with his head including against manchester united at ucl messi is scoring his trademark goals they look so happy together i have seen that match many times puskas and ads were unbelievable puskas ads goals nobody will ever come close to that my t pele puskas ads cruyff beckenbauer messi i remember ramos hammering messi s ankles back in the early mid s wtf soccer players fake as hell telling neymar amp mbappe he s leaving to play with the scouse messi at everton messi you re not diving into any sources he too dey feel himself abeg na why messi dey always outshine him football fans are so funny a conversation about bale has turned to a messi ronaldo fight messi the best player in the world has ever seen promised a ucl is coming to camp nou soon and it still hasn t come but barca fans hope ake and kesse can win them the ucl funny enough messi cam and we cook you let dembouz lewa and raphinha carry him he is still the best passer in the world won t succeed playing rwf legs are gone i really think there are very high chances that messi the goat will win qatar and i ll be there to see it all happen as a messi fans we have suffered a lot during bartomeu s era now it s our time to celebrate make una follow me for a quick follow back hobipalooza asuu weuro messi bbnaija bigwiz mbeeeer he he his messi overshadowed and what has pep guardiola has to do with this i know you hate him or messi cuz they own your small club that was both their first seasons in a new league you didn t bring about context about messi missing of his games and had multiple injuries so i didn t either also respond to my point messi scored a hattrick against real madrid at so age isn t a issue for messi just in real madrid are in heavy talks with lionel messi they want him to be a backup for mohamed salah who has just completed his move to real madrid where he can find hos level on the bench it didn t look like a mistake when he left tho he joined a league that was good for older players guaranteed league titles if he won juventus their first cl after years his legacy would have been way better than messi can t even crop it make chelsea buy this guy abeg make i see who be messi and ronaldo want him to do this with messi she is not going to jail they got a trial set up plus everybody in spain get tagged with tax evasion messi ronaldo can t wait to see messi playing with my own eyes so excited for qatar if i m any club coach even if messi is i will buy him because his football knowledge too choke see how fast those barca boys have even matured messi was the top scorer of barcelona with neymar warr pott tournament for pornaldo he did not won european golden boots in last years and cry for ballon d or pendu fam messi gt god it s not about excuses though messi was poor last season but he s got credit coz he s played games less than ronaldo ronaldo s played more games and got less assists less g as and only marginally more goals but is better that needs explaining more don t you think and messi missed a simple penalty eps of the score not even mbappe saved him that time to tap a ball u have to be good thats why he has the record of more missed penaltys in ucl when penaldo lose no

come to creating chances and making use of petty opportunities i love both of them remove ronaldo from there and they finished without messi lille were champions ronaldo held back benzema and benz prefers messi over him cry messi has a vvv good relationship with galtier so you think messi instigated all this that he went to search for some goats and asked the animals to do a photo shoot with

similarity between messi neymar diego maradona i have seen the player who will inherit my place in argentine football and his name is messi messi is a genius johan cruyff for the world of football messi is a treasure because he is a role model for children around the world messi will be the player to win the most ballons d or in history he will win five six seven he is incomparable he s in a different league no we don t need messi anymore thank u messi i have been paralyzed from the waist down and bound to a wheelchair for years then one of my friends decided to turn on argentine dwarf highlights i finally got the urge and stood up to turn that trash off thank you for helping me my idol messi without goals still contributes ronaldo gets all the chances so he gets most of the goals finished messi is still better imagine it was ronaldo who lost to liverpool roma and bayern the way messi did he said the angle of that goal is insane i watched it and it didn t even move me like that s the bare minimum for messi why is he tryna gas it media always had a agenda against messi penaldo is finished just that they blame messi for everything you live n your world of lies and manipulation hate to say it but i don t see messi running from pillar to looking for a club the goat debate ended yeah and he also dropped goals in ligue for a superteam it goes both ways ronaldo has never struggled that bad outside of real madrid because he doesnt need the team to play for him as much as messi does i m a man utd fan and as sad as it is to accept i totally understand why cr is buzzing to leave the club he s burning with desire to be crowned king of world football especially with his arch rival and arguably one of the goat lionel messi still easily winning trophies in i already know my heart pure like messi s football send us messi next season too thanks x no he s not messi is so clear no other goat can be this human man messi is class via barcelona xavi hints at messi s return the story of messi and barca is not over this is why there is no debate messi has lower expectations and standards this means you can t be the goat goats are ones who are criticized even when doing well no it wasnt lol it was for this magazine not adidas who cares when messi owned ronaldo in champions league final and semifinal so don t cry for assist tapin merchant factos man pendu guy in barca shirt supposed to be messi or pedri or who you re missing the point its not about ronaldo or messi s playstyle being suited to the team its about barcelona playing a certain way only to accommodate messi ronaldo never really had that luxury messi is phenomenally clear in footballing ability all i see is messi and messi fans being rent free in your head every time messi touches the ball it feels special messi lingard is back yeah messi and ronaldo era when messi scores goals and ronaldo when they used to score lmao injuries no messi horrible financial situation a new manager yet barca was still able to secure a top and get the better transfer window we ll see how well it goes for real madrid again there is nothing wrong with being boring but messi and ronaldo are the standard pep never would have gone for messi how did eth come lol and whi should i know him i knew he was ajax manager but i don t watch ajax matches u know who portos current manager or even dortmunds i don t care

ability and he doesn t take anybody on out of his depth as a winger in a top side that would mean any player who actually played in this generation it would be ronaldo messi ronaldinho zidane ibrahimovic i stand corrected but it s insane to argue to the first it s effective now you want flashy even messi has one dribbling style the point of the video is to show how he contributes to the attack rather than just camping for goals it was ad shoot from adidas during jersey release of arg for wc cr holds the majority share in dubai o ndor he awards himself without pr neymar is bigger and talented than cr ever was without pr and social media cr doesn t sit in messi bracket never said he didnt deserve for the team to be built around him he did doesnt change the fact that the way they played was made to suit messi then left to play in an attack of neymar and mbappe in the worst top league itw now compare that to ronaldo s career best crap movie of shamsherareview shamshera

similarity between messi neymar messi with neymar and mbappe doing teams like guingamp nantes clermont auxerre brestois dirty while ronaldo scoring goals against the half premier league teams with sancho fred and mctominay messi is the goat talkyourtalk messi congrats to on insta forthe win huge messi fan so going to a good home thanks for the support i just dey laugh how tf dey compare this

back to haunt me the same way i love messi messi he is my live bro mess is everything for me messi is the real goat messi messi literally played for the greatest team of all time at only years old and had a team built around him and then left for a literal superteam way easier career than ronaldo like messi messi fanboys and messi haters are having a dumb off under a lingard post i wish football players were like this moment ronaldo shows personality i m so glad i m a messi fan sorry man but it s true i ve more ronaldo haters passing as messi fans than i ve seen actual messi fans why would messi come into that had the most expensive squad in and and finished trophyless in both seasons not messi s fault he s ass i am a die hard messi fan but cristiano played in man utd with a poor manager and a bad team even with that he was top scorer in the pl and that at the age of is mindblowing and has all my respect re watched the ucl final exciting end end match the goals were shocking defensive lapse s on juve s part that concludes my xavi messi iniesta ucl final trilogy watch xavi the winner followed by iniesta he showed incredible level s across the finals wdym mainly the tweet isn t true messi stook with barcelona even in the toughest side could of went city cr left utd when their players were started to age and stopped winning pl s by and he joined a real madrid side which in that window bought amazing players thats cus he quite literally scored in a record amount of games in similar fashion to messi at his best remove those goals and he still had fantastic performances jose mourinho said messi is a god of football heading the ball is also part of football messi can t do it as well as ronaldo how can one use one attribute to determine who s better when it s not even the most important attribute of his position pure art from leo messi tdc he scored more ucl than messi last year and had outside the box espn is messi and barcelona media outlets i d like it lad plays

prefer streaming ronaldo in pre season before dealing with them lionel messi planned to purchase of the club documents featured lionelmessi better than lionel messi and neymar if you genuinely think messi is better than ronaldo u have zero ball knowledge this leo messi goal ran it back to the dribbling the speed and the finish you must be using truthsocial and not this app pochettino wasted a year of messi playing year left can t forgive him for that poch took the money and became leonardo s puppet might have ruined his career in doing so that fan base bare goal ya messi ke tapin he never said mbappe is bad though and messi is not bad either unless you watch football with agenda same people that said messi wouldn t hack it in the physical premier league messi single person in entire footballing history to loose soo many finals n yet has audacity to celebrate friendly match and media calling him goat for no reason the messi v ronaldo debates are slowly dying finally players with most goals in cup finals lionel messi goals pele goals neymar goals cristiano ronaldo goals romario goals messi cr ucl messi has been doing what ronaldo did for just one season for years and messi always qualified for champions league football barca messi can win it when he comes back cr fans having tough times after messi s copa america with best player of the tournament poor cr and his fans lost peace court fixes date to rule on marriage between grandfather granddaughter zamfara nigerian news court zamfara bbnaija messi wizkid davido messi always ronaldo s last goal for madrid a header from a cross from faithful teammate marcelo messi s last goal for barcelona a header from a cross from faithful teammate busquets coincidence i think not muller is more of a playmaker than a goalscorer and his stats back it in the season he had an xa of p beaten only by ousmane dembele and since when he made his professional debut only lionel messi has recorded more assist and still he is underappreciated he dickrides messi on twitter and futbin he literally has no life well considering how shit messi is it wont even surprise me if what you said is facts nysc makes demand from nigerian army terrorism news nigerianarmy nysc terrorism bbnaija messi wizkid davido tbh r and messi are no way near cr just fax the messi effect messi won mvp yesterday and you cant think far united kraa gave ronaldo player of the month for scoring only a goal the whole month sometimes cry less but acting like messi wasn t also superb in that game ain t it tbf you don t want leo messi wasting his energy preeeing defenders look at his final years at barca they had grizi dembele etc to do his pressing for him it s a waste of his energy but at psg he has to press jesus arron u hate messi with a passion see u in every posts related to messi how much does ronaldo pay u to suck his dick day and night idc about stats tell me about the stats between u and ronaldo in bed you obviously misunderstood my tweet i never said messi was average i said the average version of messi which is still probably the best in the world was similar to salah messi sent suarez a special message that was played during his nacional unveiling ain t gon lie i was a messi fanboy in messi i loveeee messi lionel messi has not broken a scoring record in years won a top league title in years won the ucl in years scored in a ucl final in years scored a hat trick in major tournaments all time and scored goals last season but he s supposedly top of all time meet prionel messi bayern bayern liverpool psg real madrid juventus roma messi couldn t make the ligue team of the season he bottled the ucl amp french cup hahaha bro messi has been submitting a transfer request for season not bks barca is not good but he said he want d team to rebuild n b strong without him right footed goal too he s feeling the inside amp going to cook this season this ll be fun messi they didn t want to include messi he d ruin it the german messi bro just said ronaldo is close to messi in footballing ability fwd cristiano ronaldo huge uncertainty over future at mun kane haaland worth extra m and poor price point unlikely to start gw few pre season minutes when martial has looked good seems to have poor relationship with eth messi gt gt come on man there are levels psg was a beast team last season having best winning probablity still where were those messi goals last season cristiano outscoring messi kane with that man utd team he even had more individual awards and motms than messi had league goals messi and neymar without mbappe i noticed messi and neymar s social media engagements reduced immediately they left bar a this is facts nobody runs pr for their players like bar a does why would he do that psg will likely make him an offer he can t refuse like a lifetime contract with a front office job when he retires from playing barca can t compete with that messi also said he wanted to play in the prem before he retires stop acting like you re running for can president deji adeyanju to peter obi news can dejiadejanju peterobi bbnaija messi wizkid davido how times have changed even messi the goat doesn t wear no anymore pray for messi acl in fajr you cant compare players when they had different roles stop acting blind i sire hope you know how to differenciate player roles and i also hope it s just your agenda against messi and not just you lacking football knowledge messi will end his career in argentina messi goals copa del rey spain supercup wc goals copa america goals champions finals goals europe supercup goals world clubs goals in spain wow super quality player but when u took barca away from him he is just like everyone else the media is fully against ronaldo man they don t even hide their bias at this point they don t do none of this to messi it s crazy cause they supposed to be neutral give messi a cup final and he dominates messi s shot no fit turn lion and fire naa shaolin soccer is always goated messi was never this good but we must sign vvd and ronaldo and messi and mbappe and neymar and cos people like super dave the transfer dude or whatever his name is mentions it people take it as gospel as if they re playing on beginner fifa no cus fr shit is crazy how they be hating when ronaldo and messi don t even know them messi has never scored in a copa del rey final against real madrid let s be guided stop crying in my mentions called me a dickrider when your whole account is about hating messi not praising cr get a grip messi was a playmaker it s like comparing kdb to haaland that s the reason messi has more assists than goals as he finished top assister in ligue had it not been pr ronaldo is nowhere near messi s talent the worse thing the world has ever witnessed is comparing ronaldo to messi brother i can show you hundreds of posts where these same accounts have trolled messi and praised ronaldo and don t even start on their football ability you will get the gap smaller than the gap between ur forehead and ur hairline messi will score goals in all comps next season lmao without perez and pr there is no goat debate as messi is miles clear in everything they were the best team in a tournament that has teams and invites haiti panama etc no excuses also took them years to win a trophy since messi s debut compared to the years trophyless before his debut the last time ronaldo scored messi was years he s now mfs thinking that this small clip is what made me decide messi s better no it s been evident since i just stopped being biased messi clear g pep without messi has i have an immense amount of love for this goal from messi against betis in as for favourite goal i ve seen in person it has to be the free kick against rangers juve youngster trajectory plays minutes and makes one good pass j twitter falls in love player is loaned out despite twitter scouts calling player x the next messi years later that same player is sold to a division team in yemen for a goat and a selfie they didn t flop he pushed them out because he didn t need them ibrahimovic had quite good stats under pep g a in apps iirc but messi is

being older and playing with bbc the greatest midfielders of all time he s still behind messi in both individual and team trophies sad messi is very ignorant and doesn t know what he s talking about at all i ve come across him before his arrogance and ignorance are astounding he s trying to tell me what my bible says in a language that he cannot read for himself absolutely that s why he regularly gets fewer touches than the gk in games even his teammates know not to give him the ball anywhere but in or close to the penalty area but let score two tapins and he s better than messi or maradona

foreva ed bro messi is only in the goat debate because of statpadding undeserved awards and the dribbling of ronaldo beats him all ends up ronaldo should have and messi should have argue with your wall people say nobody could ever be a top goalscorer and a top playmaker like messi is but rooney was probably the closest thing the premier league has seen in terms of quality not longevity sorry to say this but the only time ronaldo outperformed messi was in season only like who has their sister run their accounts especially when she s also a dumbass messi is much smarter messi is extremely hard working too and ronaldo is extremely talented as well really don t like this argument makes sense r and dinho were extremely talented yet they never achieved what ronnie and messi have there s a
